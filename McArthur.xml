                        <note>Reverend John William Lewis Bampfield joined the Chesapeake on July 24th 1857 and was a regular contributor to and
                            supporter of The Young Idea. While his age is not recorded in the muster book, census records reveal that Bampfield was
                            born in June of 1823, so he was in his mid-thirties during the cruise. He was commissioned as chaplain aboard a different
                            royal naval vessel in Port Royal, Jamaica before his arrival aboard the Chesapeake. His detailed journal provides an
                            additional witness to The Young Idea, providing fascinating points of contrast from the facsimile edition that McArthur
                            had printed in 1867 and offering hints about the authorship of contributions through his inclusion of the initials of
                            authors (a marked list).</note>

                        <note>Harry Edmund Edgell joined the Chesapeake as Commodore after the period chronicled in the issues included in this
                            edition. He was an enthusiastic supporter of The Young Idea. In <hi rend="italics">Martello Tower" in China, and the
                                Pacific in H.M.S. "Tribune," 1856-60</hi>, Francis Martin Norman recounts Edgell's enthusiastic support for a
                            shipboard theatrical aboard H.M.S. Tribune in 1857, when he was captain of the ship. Edgell composed the prologue for the
                            play and painted the drop-scene (50). The National Maritime Museum at Greenwich (NMM) holds over 300 watercolors by
                            Edgell, including some undertaken during the cruise chronicled in The Young Idea. The NMM's biographical note on Edgell
                            reads as follows: "Edgell was promoted to lieutenant in 1828, to commander in 1837 and to captain in 1846. He was
                            appointed to command the Tribune in 1855 when she was in the Crimea. During this commission she went to the Pacific and
                            finally to China. In 1857 Edgell was the Senior Naval Officer at Hong Kong and he transferred into the Bittern tender
                            commanding the gun boats on the Canton River during the hostilities with the Chinese. In 1858 be was given command of the
                            squadron in Indian waters, during which time he commanded the Chesapeake and later the Retribution. The latter returned to
                            England and was paid off in 1860. Edgell had no further active employment and was promoted on the retired list, reaching
                            the rank of vice-admiral in 1871."</note>

                                naval officer, was the eldest son of Captain Joshua Rowley Watson (1772–1810). He entered the navy in November 1821,
                                and was promoted lieutenant on 7 October 1829. [...] On 23 December 1842 he was advanced to post rank, and on 24
                                December was made a CB. [...] In December 1852 [Watson] was appointed to the new steam frigate Impérieuse (50 guns),
                                then, and for some years later, considered one of the finest ships in the navy. In 1854 she was sent into the Baltic
                                in advance of the fleet, Watson being senior officer of the squadron of small vessels appointed to watch the breaking
                                up of the ice, and to see that no Russian warships got to sea. It was an arduous service well performed. The
                                Impérieuse continued with the flying squadron in the Baltic during the campaigns of 1854 and 1855, and until the
                                signing of peace in March 1856. As the senior officer of the frigate squadron, and generally on detached service,
                                Watson demonstrated the highest standards of seamanship, judgement, and leadership. After the peace the Impérieuse was
                                sent to the North American station; she returned to England and was paid off early in 1857. From May 1856 until his
                                death Watson was naval aide-de-camp to the queen. In June 1859 he was appointed captain-superintendent of Sheerness
                                Dockyard, where he died on 5 July 1860. An officer of great ability, Watson was one of the last great sailing-ship
                                captains, and the first frigate captain of the steam era."</quote></note>

                            at the broadest point, with a depth in the hold of 23 feet 11 inches. As Lyon and Winfield explain, "Corvette designs were

                            this end they were all built as steam auxiliaries, designed to cruise under sail" (207). HMS Pelorus was broken up for

                    <!-- don't forget to format this as a letter...just transcribing the body for now -->
                    <p>On Wednesday the 9th a grand dinner party was given by the Ward Room Officers of H.M.S. Chesapeake to their commodore, in honor
                        of his having on that day hoisted his Broad Pendant</p>
                    <pb n="IMG_1406l.JPG"/>
                    <p>I will not encroach too much on your valuable time, by entering fully into minute details, but proceed to describe, as well,
                        and briefly, as I am able, one of the great features of the week. There is little occasion to name the Bill of Fare, as it
                        might make sundry people's mouths water to no purpose; suffice it to say the table was served in a most
                        "recherche<!-- the e is accented -->" style; the good looking and well dressed sailor boys, being remarkably attentive; the
                        whole being under the able management of Mr. Geo Hoadley, the Mess Steward.</p>
                    <p>Scandal, says, that several cries were heard from the background, much resembling the noise that boys make when under
                        punishment, and therefore avers, that the boys' good conduct arose from the fact of a Corporal, having been seen to enter the
                        ward room previous to dinner, with what sailors call a "persuader" in his hand. But as I make it a practice to turn a deaf ear
                        to scandal, (altho' readers may draw their own conclusions) still I am of opinion that they (the boys) have been too well
                        drilled, and the system too good, to allow such a derogatory report to gain ground in any right minded person's opinion. You
                        must pardon me, for having thus digressed from my subject, but as calumnious reports quickly get abroad, and such an one might
                        prove detrimental to that well regulated mess. I take this opportunity of nipping it in the bud: -to proceed:-The culinary
                        department, under the care of Mons: do Blanchearde, (who bids fair to outrival Mr Soyer) gave every satisfaction and the well
                        satisfied look that rested on everyone's face, on the removal of the cloth, would, could he only have seen it, have repaid him
                        well for his unremitting zeal.</p>
                    <p>Dessert on the table, and the glasses filled, the usual loyal toast was drunk to the splendid band of the ship, under their
                        leader, Signor Faustine, playing "God save the Queen" followed immediately by "The return of the Admiral". Some slight mistake
                        appears to have been made, in the time appointed for the playing of this Air; but to the fact of the Bandmaster being a
                        foreigner, and as yet, not initiated into English customs, must this mistake be attributed</p>
                    <p>After the strains of music had ceased the President Capt. Piers, in an appropriate speech proposed the health of Commodore
                        Watson CB which was drunk with enthusiasm, and no heel tops <note>"no heel tops" is a call made when one has not emptied their
                            glass after a toast</note>, the band playing as before, the "Return of the Admiral" ...</p>

                        long voyage has now come to a close, we may consider that we have arrived at our destination, that our future prospects centre

                    <p>What these prospects may be, we are unable to determine at present, although, we may almost dispel the idea of seeing service
                        before the enemy, as we had hoped, our proceedings will most likely consist in various kinds of extra duties, as unpleasant as
                        they are unremunerative.</p>
                    <p>But, at this, we must not repine, for, as <persName ref="#Watson">our gallant Commodore</persName> expressed in his speech last
                        Sunday, we do as much good, in assisting the arrival, or departure of vessels, in provisioning, storing, repairing, conveying
                        troops or other equally tame work, as though we were in the field; no doubt, some may be inclined to say, that this<cb n="2"/>
                        is merely a propitiatory view of the case, but, we say, it is the fact, and although our inclination leads us to think
                        otherwise and to feel dissatisfied with the failure of our dearest hopes, yet, this should not lessen our zeal in the exercise
                        of our various duties, and hope must brighten our path with the expectation, of not always having such unsatisfactory
                        employment.</p>
                    <p>We cannot disguise the fact that we are "too late for the fair," but yet an old adage says "better late than never" and who
                        knows, or who can foretell, what fortunate circumstances may occur, to reward us for our present disappointment.</p>
                    <p>Of the present state of the rebellion we cannot venture to say much; on shore, one heard little or <pb n="TYI1072"

                    <p>Our information of what is proceeding is therefore very limited, but we hope that next week we may be able to procure
                        intelligence of the successful career of that gallant soldier <persName ref="#Campbell">Sir Colin Campbell</persName>, as well
                        as of a speedy termination to the disturbances in India.</p>

                    <p>Here we are at last! the external appearance is novel and not uninteresting, what is the interior? Such were our reflections
                        when we had time to look around us, and witness the busy scene,- boats of various shapes and build, dropping with the tide,
                        with their swarthy crews, and the steersman wrapped in a linen robe, wielding the huge oar with which he guides the boat;
                        magnificent merchant ships laying close in shore for repairs, discharging cargo, or other purposes, the forest of masts which
                        met the gaze when it extended up the river, the hum of distant voices, the strange figures, carriages &amp; vehicles of
                        various descriptions passing along the Esplanade, all united to excite us with their novelty, and we were forced to satisfy
                        our curiosity by visiting the shore.</p>
                    <p>On landing we were assailed by numbers of importunate palanquin<cb n="2"/> bearers, who would hardly listen to the negatives we
                        returned to their vociferations of "Palankie Sail" However we managed to escape in safety, and were pursuing our course
                        towards the town when young lad came forward with an umbrella, and notwithstanding our decisive refusals of his services, he
                        persisted in following and shading us from the sun.</p>
                    <p>We found him useful, and intelligent, and had no cause to regret making his acquaintance; he guided us to the bazaars, which
                        reminded us forcibly of the like places for vending goods and merchandize in <placeName ref="#Istanbul"
                            >Constantinople</placeName>. The small low shops and dirty lanes, for we cannot designate them streets, the various
                        costumes of the natives, yellow, blue, red and white, the most part clothed in little save their tawny skins, all meeting the
                        eye in a variegated mass, as the whole extent of the bazaar was comprehended at a glance, the creaking of the drays, or
                        waggons, drawn by two small buffaloes, and made of bamboos, with most primitive wheels and harness, the shouts of the
                        palanquin bearers, as they staggered under the weight of some corpulent old gentleman, who perhaps, entertained the opinion
                        that the sun might melt him, were he to expose himself; the touting of the vendors, who, with salaams, begged us to walk into,
                        each, his particular shop, and become their customers, all this and many other circumstances which struck us at the time,
                        brought back very strongly to our memories the streets and bazaars of <placeName ref="#Istanbul"

                    <p>After purchasing what we required, and we found that the prices first demanded were high but easily beaten down, we determined
                        to visit now the Esplanade, and see what was going on there. We dismissed our guide with a fee with which he appeared very
                        well pleased, &amp; having refreshed ourselves with an ice at Browne's Hotel, we left our purchases there and strolled forth
                        upon the Esplanade.</p>
                    <p>Here we found Rotten Row, in miniature, whilst upon the green the lovers of exercise amused themselves with cricket, and
                        quoits. The roads were thronged with vehicles &amp; carriages of every description native and European, filled with ladies
                        &amp; gentlemen, enjoying the fresh air; after the sun had expended his power.</p>
                    <p>The complexions of the ladies did not appear to us to have suffered from the heat of the climate, but we suppose they take care
                        not to expose themselves during the day, and thus escape, we could not for one instant entertain an idea of artificial means
                        being resorted to.</p>
                    <p>They certainly appeared to pay as much attention to fashion as in England, but we could not wonder at that, when we saw the
                        immense millinery, and bonnet establishments which with open doors and temptingly displayed head dresses, robes, mantles,
                        &amp;c, &amp;c invited the victims to enter and become an easy prey.</p>
                    <p>The shades of night falling fast and thick, and not wishing to remain any longer on shore, we returned on board, not as well
                        satisfied with <placeName ref="#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName>, at first sight, as we had hoped to be.</p>

                            ref="#Hugli_River">Hooghly</placeName>. At 6 P.M. we obtained soundings with the deep sea lead and two hours afterwards
                        judging ourselves to be sufficiently near the Pilot station, we anchored for the night in 17 fathoms water, our anchor was
                        again weighed at daylight &amp; about 9 A.M. we passed the first large Buoy that marks the approach to the Eastern channel. At
                        noon we were nearing the Pilot Brig, and the Pilot shortly afterwards came on board. We now ran in till 3 P.M. when the strong
                        tide turning against us, we were again anchored for the night in 7 fathoms water. At Evening Quarters we moved several of the
                        after guns forward to bring the vessel to an even keel: still no land in sight, though the red haze in the Evening horizon
                        seemed to tell of its vicinity.</p>
                    <p>Daylight again found us under way and about 10 A.M. we descried the low banks of the <placeName ref="#Hugli_River"
                            >Hooghly</placeName>, opening on either side of us. With the strong tide in our favor, and our engines working at full
                        power, we now advanced very rapidly; the river banks drew nearer to us; <placeName ref="#Sāgar_Island">Saugar</placeName>
                        appeared on our right <placeName ref="#Khejuri">Kedgeree</placeName> on our left, with a little cluster of shipping at the
                        anchorage. The water which on the previous day had been of a greenish hue, now became very thick and muddy. Objects on shore
                        now became more distinct as the river lessened in width, the banks were still low &amp; level, not an outline of any distant
                        hills to be seen, here &amp; there a rice plantation varied the jungle Native villages, generally clustered about some creek,
                        where a smaller stream <pb n="TYI1074" facs="TYI1074"/><fw>The Young Idea Saturday 23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> January
                            1858.</fw><cb n="1"/> joined the main river, now, and then called our attention. In the stream, we passed many vessels,
                        less favoured than ourselves, taking advantage of the tide to move up the river; others in their downward course, lying at
                        anchor till the tide should turn. Now we observed traces of the European settler, the tall factory of red brick, the neat
                        white house with green blinds drawn down over the windows, the regular avenue of trees, the cultivated patches of sugar cane,
                        the brick field with piles of bricks, furnished from the dark alluvial clay, of which doubtless, the whole Delta of the Ganges
                        is composed. As we moved swiftly up, the banks of the river glided past like a moving panorama, and the eye could never tire
                        of watching the beautiful scene.</p>
                    <p>At sunset we came to an anchor in the <placeName ref="#Garden_Reach">Garden Reach</placeName>, 2 miles below <placeName
                            ref="#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName>, one or two pretty houses decked the banks, a forest of masts marked the position of
                        the great capital. a deep red tinge, suffused the sky as the sun sank, and was reflected streakily in the ebbing tide, soon
                        darkness came, the river's banks were left to the howling jackal, or the crickets and toads, that made a ceaseless whirring
                        through the watches of the night.</p>

                    <head> Try Again </head>
                    <p>It is seldom that any great &amp; unprecedented undertaking will meet with the complete success at the first trial: - the great
                        engineering triumphs of the present century have mostly taught us to expect failure before we achieve success: the Thames
                        Tunnel, the Eddystone Lighthouse, the Plymouth Breakwater, because novel &amp; unexampled works, were therefore in the first
                        instance unsuccessful.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore with no surprize that we heard recently either that the Atlantic Telegraph had failed in the first attempt to
                        lay it down, or that the Great Eastern "refuses to move from the spot where it has been built. A second attempt was made to
                        induce this monster of the deep, to take to its aquatic elements; but a second time, it resisted all arguments whether of
                        force or persuasion.</p>
                    <p>A fair lady bestowed its name, and called it<cb n="2"/> "Leviathan" but "Leviathan was as resolute as "Great Eastern" and still
                        remained upon the shore. "Try again" must be the motto of the builders.</p>
                    <p>Again, we read in an other part of our news that "Big Ben,"-the huge Bell that is to swing in the Clock tower of the Palace of
                        Westminster,-"Big Ben" is cracked, his metal was too thin, or his tongue was too thick, and he will now have to be broken up,
                        and his makers must "Try again" before they bring their work to completion.</p>
                    <p>But all these failures, we say, might reasonably be expected; whenever we attempt anything great and noble and unprecedented,
                        neither a first, nor a second, nor a third failure must daunt us. "Try again" must be our motto, and success will eventually
                        crown our perseverance.</p>

                        European houses, intermingled with the low, dingy-roofed bazaars of the natives, the spires of the Christian Churches, the

                    <p>On Saturday (Nov.r 23rd) a third attempt was made to move this gigantic vessel, which we are happy to say was eminently

                        of the ship was regulated according as Mr. Brunel thought fit, with as much care and certainty, as if the vessel had been a

                        the relief of <placeName ref="#Lucknow">Lucknow</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>As it was understood that most of the <placeName ref="#Lucknow">Lucknow</placeName> people would be present the occasion
                        presented too much interest for us to neglect witnessing it, and partaking in the ceremony.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly at 1/4 to 10 a.m. we left the ship and engaged a buggy at the landing place, into which four of us were speedily
                        stowed: the driver took us through Fort William and we were thus enabled to take a cursory view of the interior.</p>
                    <p>Here we saw several of the native soldiers on guard without any arm save their ramrods, a significant token of the little trust
                        that can be placed upon these men at the present crisis. </p>
                    <p>After leaving the fort we emerged upon the race course, the grand stand &amp; swimming post suggesting to our minds the
                        exciting scenes, which we had unfortunately missed witnessing, by not reaching this place at an earlier season.</p>
                    <p>It was not long now ere we arrived at the cathedral, although had it not been for a sharp look out kept on our driver, he would
                        most probably have taken us out into the country, as he did not appear to under<cb n="2"/>stand perfectly where we were
                        desirous of being driven to, and was taking a course very different to that we wished. </p>
                    <p>On entering the sacred edifice we found that we were very late, but yet managed to obtain seats, although the position was not
                        good being behind the pulpit.</p>
                    <p>The interior of the building is spacious and airy; the seats are formed of a species of arm chair, thus portioning off to each
                        one a fair space, and even crinoline must share the same as a gentleman of the most slender proportions and consequently no
                        lady could appropriate to herself more room than would be found convenient to a next seat neighbour. We cannot say how the
                        fair sex approve of this arrangement.</p>
                    <p>From the light roof, iron girders dropped, and joined frames of the same material, which ran from one side to the other; we
                        supposed these are intended for the use of punkahs during the hot weather</p>
                    <p>Over the altar a fine large painted window, representing the Crucifixion, attracted our attention. The Pulpit, choir, Altar
                        &amp; reading Desks, were draped in black, and noticing that a large number of the congregation were also arrayed in the sable
                        garments of mourning, we were painfully re<pb n="TYI1084" facs="TYI1084"/><fw>"The Young Idea" Saturday 30<hi

                        characterized late times.</p>
                    <p>From our position in the rear of the Preacher (<persName ref="#Pratt">Archdeacon Pratt</persName>) we were unfortunately unable
                        to hear his discourse fully, but its main design was to show the great mercy of Almighty God in thus relieving a people who
                        had deemed themselves lost, and had made up their minds to die, as well as to teach us how grateful we should be for all His
                        Mercies, and to put our trust in Him alone.</p>
                    <p>We heard the sounds of subdued sobs from the body of the church, and surely it was sufficient to drain tears of joy and
                        gratitude from those who were so fresh from the scene of danger and distress.</p>
                    <p>We left the cathedral deeply impressed, with the solemnity, and applicability of the service we had witnessed.</p>

                            <p>While walking the Deck by moonlight, in a contemplative mood, on Thursday Evening, two animals of the order "Rodentia,"
                                usually called "rats" were observed by the Quartermaster near the main mast. Being much troubled by the apparition,
                                and having an intense aversion to anything in the shape of a rat, (except the rat-tat of the postman's knock) I hasten
                                to inform you of the approach of these formidable foes. I sincerely hope, that our smart, though juvenile members of
                                the feline tribe may now be duly trained and disciplined to meet the foe, and I doubt not that a whole host of asiatic
                                rats will soon be made to fly before the sharp claws of a few brave British cats.</p>

                    <p> Already one twelfth of the New Year has flown, and we find ourselves rapidly entering into the second month. </p>
                    <p>In this short space of time we have seen much, done much, and heard much: already we miss the faces of one or two shipmates,
                        and expect others to fill their places, and thus it ever is, and ever will be; -faces, and forms will change in the ever
                        revolving diorama of a sailor's life</p>
                    <p>We have received our long looked for, eagerly anticipated letters, we have heard from those at home, at the very sight of whose
                        handwriting, we have felt our breasts thrill with emotions of pleasure, and joy, and if such feelings are experienced by a
                        mere knowledge of the characters of the address, we can readily fathom the happiness<cb n="2"/> the glow of exultation, the
                        interest with which we break the seal, and first with rapid glance devour the contents, abstracting the news greedily, in
                        order to learn all in a moment.</p>
                    <p>Then comes the second reading, and now we ponder over every word, we digest every sentence, and carefully peruse every line,
                        receiving fresh pleasure from every perusal, and being borne back in memory to our happy homes, where we can fancy we
                        see<lb/>"++++++++" the light<lb/>"of household fires gleam warm &amp; bright"<lb/>we fancy we can hear the joyous laugh of
                        merry friends, the hearty gratulations of the season; we fancy we can feel the warm grasp of friendly recognition, the
                        endearing embrace of parents, sisters, wives, or sweethearts; we read their wishes, their soul breathed <pb n="TYI1092"

                        <cb n="1"/> wishes for our happiness, and welfare; and as we close the pages which have expanded our hearts with more real
                        enjoyment, than we have experienced since we parted from the oft remembered writers, we come back to the cold stern reality of
                        distance, of our separation.</p>
                    <p>But, stop! We have only spoken of pleasure, as derived from the receipt of letters from our homes; there is yet another view of
                        the matter, and, this, brings grief, in lieu of joy; tears, instead of smiles; and sorrow usurps the place of mirth.</p>
                    <p>Note! Some poor comrade receives a letter whose sable edges bespeak the contents; see! with what trembling hand, and bursting
                        heart he retires into some corner, where in secret he can trace with tearful eyes, the lines which convey the sad intelligence
                        of the death of some dear relative, or friend.</p>
                    <p>Tis thus that each mail must produce different emotions amongst a body of men, and while some are filled with joy,<cb n="2"/>
                        others are drooping with pain and trouble.</p>
                    <p>May we know little of this latter.</p>

                    <head> The Lucknow Tigers. </head>
                    <p>As we believe that many of our readers have availed themselves of our recommendation last week to ascend the Monument on the
                        Esplanade, we will venture to call attention in like manner to the beautiful <placeName ref="#Lucknow">Lucknow</placeName>
                        tigers which may be seen on the payment of one Rupee in Wood Street, Chowringhee.</p>
                    <p>They have been lately brought from <placeName ref="#Lucknow">Lucknow</placeName>, where they formed a portion of the Royal
                        Menagerie which the Kings of <placeName ref="#Ayodhya">Oude</placeName> have been in the habit of maintaining. </p>
                    <p>The first Tiger you see on entering is a beautiful creature most remarkable for its tameness. At <placeName ref="#Lucknow"
                            >Lucknow</placeName> it had been brought up by hand, and led about with only a chain round its neck. It would allow little
                        children to play with it in passing along the streets, and the people of <placeName ref="#Lucknow">Lucknow</placeName>
                        lamented when they saw it put into a cage, to be carried away.</p>
                    <p>There are 6 or 7 others, of which we recollect two particularly, one because of its ferocious growl, the only savage one, and
                        the other as being the largest of all, and distinguished for the beauty of its stripes, which, it will be observed, are all
                        double.</p>
                    <p>There is a leopard, which is rather too apt to put its paws through the cage, and a chetah <pb n="TYI1093" facs="TYI1093"

                        only confined by a chain, and seems perfectly tame, licking its keeper's hand, and making a gruff, purring, sound, like a cat
                        with a sore throat.</p>
                    <p>There is also a fine Giraffe, perfectly tame, and we recommend visitors to beg the Sikh attendant to take a ride on its back.
                        The man, though full sized, seems quite a pigmy when mounted on the tall quadruped; and we defy any one to keep himself from
                        laughing, when the poor beast sets off at a canter.</p>

                    <head> "India" </head>
                    <p>Our papers, and our Reviews, our periodicals, have all one absorbing topic, and that is India. Fresh details of the horrible
                        sufferings which our countrymen &amp; women underwent in the earlier part of the insurrection, further particulars of the
                        movements of our gallant army, praises of those heroic spirits who have fought and perchance have fallen, before the gates of
                            <placeName ref="#Delhi">Delhi</placeName>, or within the walls of <placeName ref="#Lucknow">Lucknow</placeName>, comments
                        on the past misgovernment of the country, suggestions towards its better management for the future; these seem to form the
                        staple of what we have received by our two last mails; pictorial papers take up the same subject, and views from india, and
                        illustrations of Hindoo customs, now meet us in every page: when we open our Magazines, we find historical papers, tracing the
                        rise of the British dominion in India, dissertations on the variety of races, or essays on the religious, and various forms of
                        feeling which are to be found in this remarkable Asiatic Peninsula.</p>
                    <p>"We spared our readers," says the Times, "as much as we could the pain of revolting and horrible "images; we have no
                            objection<cb n="2"/> that they should know, that there are the most terrible details in the background of outrages
                        perpetrated upon English men and English women." </p>
                    <p>"Christianity," writes the same paper in another article, "is not a religion to be propagated by violence, but it is
                        essentially a religion to be diffused by preaching and teaching. Christians may not make converts by the sword, but they are
                        bound, where they can, to make proselytes by instruction *** our administration in India, has presented the spectacle of one
                        of the greatest Christian powers in the world sedulously bent upon ignoring its own belief.**** In future the religion of the
                        dominant race must be plainly professed, instead of being timidly kept in the background, and the field be opened to
                        missionary exertions with the sanction, instead of the disfavour, of the Government."</p>
                    <p>These sentiments, no doubt, express the feelings of the great majority of our friends in England, and we prefer giving them in
                        the powerful words of the "Times," to endeavouring to clothe them in our own poor language.</p>
                    <p>It may be sufficient for us to rejoice that at such a time, we should have been sent in our floating home, to the very spot on
                        which the eyes of the world, are turned; to see for ourselves something of those scenes which papers so fully describe to our
                        friends at home, and perchance to take part in those transactions, which are yet destined to become matters of history.</p>

                    <p> The Past Week has certainly been productive of more excitement, and enjoyment, than any we remember to have witnessed since
                        our departure from England. </p>
                    <p>One great event at least, has been its chief characteristic, one day at least, called forth more interest than the others, we

                    <p>Although on this important occasion, our men did not acquit themselves in the manner we had hoped, yet it is a source of deep
                        gratification, to know that the reigning prize of the day, the acme of ambition, the "Prize Cup" was won by our men.</p>
                    <p>Elsewhere we shall find a detailed account of the circumstances which marked the day, which we must say could not have been
                        finer or more agreeable, nor can we drop this subject without paying our tribute of admiration to the "fair sex," the bright

                        intelligence arriving soon of an attack upon <placeName ref="#Lucknow">Lucknow</placeName>: from <placeName ref="#Yangon"

                        quickly or quietly, as, by the <placeName ref="#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName> "Englishman" it is reported that Captain

                        report, as it is as yet unauthenticated.</p>
                    <p>We can only hope that we shall not be excluded from a participation of whatever may take place in that quarter.</p>

                                prove interesting <pb n="TYI1102" facs="TYI1102"/><fw>The "Young Idea" Saturday 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                                    February 1858</fw><cb n="1"/> to the Readers of the "Young Idea"</p>
                            <p>An exploring party was recently sent from <placeName ref="#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName> to visit the <placeName
                                    ref="#Andaman_Islands">Andaman Islands</placeName> in the Bay of Bengal with the view of selecting a site to
                                establish a penal colony, and to banish thither the captive King of <placeName ref="#Delhi">Delhi</placeName> and his
                                rebel Sepoys. It is remarkable that this group of Islands, tho' so near to the Asiatic Continent, are inhabited by a
                                race of savages, no way akin to the Asiatic tribes, but apparently much nearer allied to the African Negroes. They
                                live in a perfect state of nature, without the slightest vestige of a garment; their huts are mere dens or kennels
                                under which they crawl at night; in fact they seem to be among the most degraded forms of humanity.</p>
                            <p>The first salutation our explorers received was a flight of arrows, but a few musket shots soon dispersed the natives.
                                Two of them were killed, and one captured. This savage has been brought to <placeName ref="#Kolkata"
                                    >Calcutta</placeName> by Dr. ..... and both he and Mrs...... have done their best to humanize him by kind
                                treatment. He was introduced to several Negroes of different tribes, but none of them could understand his
                                language.</p>
                            <p>He shews himself not insensible to kindness, and was pleased with Dr. .....,'s little child, making signs, that he had
                                a little child also. On one occasion, wishing to show his gratitude to Mrs. ..... &amp; following the custom of his
                                country on such occasions, he took the lady's hand within both his own, raised it solemnly to his lips, and with the
                                deepest respect, spat into it.</p>

                        would take 200 or 300 sepoys to move at all; they never speak a word, and when they attack they can never be driven back; they
                        are cannibals, and eat sepoys when they have salted them down, sepoy bullets cannot kill them."</p>

                            reason="indecipherable" atLeast="7" atMost="8" unit="chars"/>" who eat cow's meat and other abominations.</p>
                    <p>I told them I was an European Officer, when they ceased their noise, and listened civilly to me. I asked why had they mutinied?
                        They replied, they were fighting for their religion. "How have we threatened your religion? By giving us greased cartridges.
                        *********</p>
                    <p>They were now desired by the Havildar, or Native Officer to fire at me, but they refused, saying they wanted to hear the Sahib
                        speak." I challenged the Havildar to come down himself, and then said I would bring him some woman's apparel, this retort
                        caused him to swear, and the others to laugh at him. They now commenced filling up the shaft, and I retired to my own gallery. </p>
                    <p><hi rend="underlined">"Escaping in disguise"</hi>. On the 9th November I sought out the spy Kunrigee Lall who - was going back
                        with despatches to <persName ref="#Campbell">Sir Colin Campbell</persName> and imparted to him my desire to venture in
                        disguise in his company My attire was soon completed; I was dressed as a Budmash, or Irregular soldier of the city, with sword
                        and shield, native made shoes, tight trousers, a yellow silk koortah over a close fitting white muslin shirt, a yellow
                        coloured chintz sheet thrown round my shoulders, a cream coloured turban, and a white waistband or "Kummerbund", My face and
                        neck down to the shoulders, and my hands to the wrists, were coloured with lampblack, the cork used being dipped in oil to
                        cause the colour to adhere. After being provided with a small double barrelled pistol, and a pair of broad pyjamahs over the
                        tight trousers, I proceeded with Kunrigee Lall to the banks of the <placeName ref="#Gomati_River">river Goomtee</placeName>.
                        We undressed and quickly forded the river, which was about 4 1/2 ft. deep, and about 100 yards wide at this point. My courage
                        failed me while in the water, and if my guide had been within reach, I should perhaps have pulled him back and abandoned
                            the<cb n="2"/> enterprize **** With my <gap reason="indecipherable"/> resting on my shoulder, we advanced among the huts
                        in front, where I accosted a matchlock man, "The night is cold"; he answered to my remark "It is very cold"*** We passed
                        unnoticed thro' a number of Sepoys and matchlock men, some of whom, were escorting persons of rank in palanquins, preceded by
                        torches. I jostled against several armed men in the street, but was not spoken to. **** I was in great spirits when we reached
                        the green fields, into which I had not been for five months Everything around us smelt sweet, and a carrot I took from the
                        roadside, was, the most delicious I ever tasted. I gave vent to my feelings in a conversation with Kenrigee Lall, who joined
                        in my admiration of the province of <placeName ref="#Ayodhya">Oudh</placeName>, and lamented that it was now in the hands of
                        wretches, whose misgovernment and rapacity was ruining it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="underlined">"Arrival at the British Camp"</hi>. By 3 o'clock in the morning we arrived at a grove of mango trees, in
                        which a man was singing at the top of his voice! He was alarmed at hearing us approach, and astonished us also, by calling out
                        a guard of 25 Sepoys, all of whom asked questions. Kunrigee Lall lost heart for the first time, and threw away the letter
                        entrusted to him for <persName ref="#Campbell">Sir Colin Campbell</persName> I kept mine safe in my turban. We satisfied the

                    <p>It was near 4 o'clock in the morning when we heard the English challenge "Who comes there?" We had reached a British cavalry
                        outpost. My eyes filled with joyful tears, and I thanked God for having safely conducted one through this dangerous
                        enterprize. </p>

                        the aboriginal Pandoos. After falling into decay and lying desolate for a period of eight centuries, it was revived again
                        (about A.D. 792) by a descendant of the ancient Kings, entitled Bulwan Deo.</p>
                    <p>It was he who changed the name from Indraprasthe to <placeName ref="#Delhi">Delhi</placeName>, the origin of which is related
                        as follows:-</p>
                    <p>"There was in one part of the city an iron "kheel" or pillar, said to have been left standing by the ancient "Pandoos"
                        Tradition attached a sacred import to this pillar, and alleged it to be based upon a pedestal fixed in the regions of hell. As
                        Bulwan Deo doubted the truth of the legend, the sceptic monarch determined to test the depth, and he caused the pillar to be
                        violently shaken. A stream of blood immediately gushed up from the earth's centre, and the pillar from that time became loose
                        or in their own language "dheli"</p>

                        back to the bowler, and was thus caught out.</p>
                    <p><persName ref="#Wilkinson">Mr Wilkinson</persName> relieved him, and "fast and furious" was the game. Mr Brownrigg serving out

                    <p>We left the ship rather late (about 7 PM the dinner being announced for 7:30) and on landing at Baboo's Ghant found to our
                        dismay that no garrie was waiting for us, this caused some little consternation, but a consultation being held, we acted
                        speedily upon its determination, &amp; were quickly ensconced in palanqains on arriving at Wilson's Hotel, we managed to
                        obtain a garrie &amp; without further delay than we could help, set off for Cossipore. Our <gap reason="indecipherable"/>
                        proved to be one of the best of his kind, keeping his cattle well up to the mark.</p>
                    <p>We passed through the dirty, dismal, native quarter, faintly lit by the flickering glare of oil lamps, with dusky, half clad
                        forms flitting about in the misty, smoky atmosphere, which made our eyes smart and fill with tears. Here and there in the
                        deep, gloomy, shade of the interior of an old and shaky building, could be seen a dark object bending over the earthenware
                        pan, in which the evening meal was cooking, whilst the flare of the lambent flame as it shot up from under, would for an
                        instant light up his dim countenance &amp; the surrounding objects, and then as instantly subsiding would render the obscurity
                        more intense than ever.</p>
                    <p>As we speeded along and left the suburbs of the city, emerging into more open country, the notes of warning our driver had been
                        repeatedly uttering, gradually ceased, and we found ourselves passing extensive gardens, with an occa<pb n="TYI1122"

                        here, &amp; there. At last we arrived at a place where four roads met, &amp; most likely would have proceeded straight on, had
                        not a figure which stood in the road acquainted our driver that his proper course was the turning to the right.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after a blaze of light on our left hand told us that we were approaching our goal, a few minutes more and we entered
                        the Rajah's garden. We were quite surprized at the number of lamps, and the brilliancy of the illuminations, it was a
                        transition from night to day: altho we consider that the effect would have been more perfect had the lamps been variegated. On
                        our left was a large tank, surrounded by railings, on which lamps were hung, close together, we are perfectly unable to judge
                        of the probable number in this spot alone, for the tank was one of the largest we have seen, &amp; the lights almost touched
                        on another: the reflection in the still water, greatly enhanced the effect, especially that caused by a large building on the
                        opposite side, which was in one perfect blaze, &amp; of which we shall speak more fully anon.</p>
                    <p>The strains of a band met our ears as we rattled down to the garden house, where upon emerging from our trap, we found the
                        dinner was proceeding. We entered and soon procured seats, which were apparently the only empty ones, for we noticed some
                        after arrivals who were unable to obtain even a corner of the table. The dinner was in every respect perfect. having been
                        placed under the sole arrangement of Messrs Wilson &amp; <choice>

                        </choice> of Auckland Hotel, we regretted much not having arrived in time to witness the appearance of the table previous to
                        the attack, but as it was (fish having been just removed) it looked remarkably well and the taste displayed in the several
                        minutiae which characterize a well laid table, spoke well for the capacity of the hands to whose care the management was
                        entrusted. The room itself was gaily decorated with banners &amp; flags of England, France and Turkey, and was well lighted by
                        chandeliers, and Moderator lamps. The many uniforms, of which red decidedly preponderated, &amp; the glittering of the naval
                        epaulettes, varied with the sober black of the civilians, greatly enhanced the brilliancy of the table.</p>
                    <p>Having appeased our appetite and slaked our thirst with first rate champagne &amp; hearing sounds of native music &amp; singing
                        in an adjoining room, we quitted the table and adjourned to the apartment whence the sounds proceeded. On our way thither we
                        stopped to examine several swords &amp; spears, daggers &amp; c of real Damascus steel and beautifully worked, the hilts &amp;
                        crosspieces, inlaid with gold and precious stones of all kinds. We also saw a magnificent diamond in a glass case, said to be
                        worth £180.000. Of furniture we cannot speak as the rooms are all furnished in Eastern style, &amp; consequently there is no
                        display of tables, and chairs, couches, settees, &amp;c, &amp;c, which we see in our commonest drawing rooms in England. One
                        small table &amp; that of marble, supported a tray with betel nut and a jug of water for the benefit of the native guests,
                        &amp; carpets, spread upon a platform in a room through which we passed, were appropriated to their use.</p>
                    <p>On entering the room from which the nautch music had proceeded, we found that we were just too late, as we caught a stern view
                        of the musicians, as they passed out of the door opposite to that we entered by. The interior presented a very gay appearance,
                        for here we saw the various garbs and picturesque dresses of the native visitors, who were seated on a cushioned seat which
                        went all round the room. Some were arrayed most magnificently <cb n="2"/>in shawls woven with gold, velvet embroiderd with
                        gold, in fact all the garments were heavy and thick with gold. The Rajah himself wore round his neck a diamond necklace valued
                        at £200,000 and almost all wore heavy massive gold chains.</p>
                    <p>The sharp whiz of a rocket announced to us that the fireworks were commencing. We immediately allied forth and found ourselves
                        in front of the tank, which was reflecting on its placid surface the last falling stars of the first rocket: carriages, &amp;
                        horses, were near and around us, and as a blaze of light suddenly illuminated the whole scene before us, the poor frightened
                        animals snorted &amp; started with terror, &amp; required the utmost efforts of the drivers to keep them from fairly bolting
                        away. Our first care was to get out of the way of anything like a horse, and then we turned to view the magnificent spectacle
                        before us. In front &amp; around us on every side, bright masses of flame, shot up in the air, dense masses of smoke curled
                        heavily upwards, thro' which flights of rockets shot with their hissing roar and blue fireballs formed their graceful
                        curves.</p>
                    <p>On our right a large piece of firework was set fire to, from its original appearance we supposed that it was intended to
                        pourtray the burning of a house, but as it quickly went into an entire flame, it only represented a burst of flame lighting up
                        the visages of those around us with a pale unearthly glare, and by the strong but fitful illumination which it cast on the
                        projecting points of the building, throwing the recesses into gloomier shadow. In various parts of the gardens, fresh gleams
                        of light shot up &amp; rockets filled the air with their fiery balls, threatening to cause some damage by their falling
                        sticks, which very often descended amongst the crowd.</p>
                    <p>The brilliant scene was rendered doubly impressive by the reflecting of water &amp; the dense volume of smoke which hung like a
                        canopy over the whole gardens. The display which formed the finale, was erected on the opposite bank of the tank, to that on
                        which we stood and when first lighted represented a square body of white fire and an arch. As the fire decreased, a blue
                        flickering flame made its appearance, and gradually increased in strength until at last in the square, we read the sentence,
                        "God save the Queen, and the Young couple every Happiness," and the arch shone forth as an arbour over which the blue flame
                        played in a wavy, flickering light. This was immediately hailed with three hearty cheers from the Officers &amp; Englishmen
                        present, and the company then strolled about enjoying in many cases the luxury of <gap reason="indecipherable"/>. We followed
                        the example and then returned to the building to witness the nautch, which was about to recommence.</p>
                    <p>After a short time the performers entered. They consisted of a girl, dressed in a dark brown gauze dress, and scarf trimmed
                        &amp; embroidered profusely with gold, and particoloured trousers, made very full so as to hide the feet. Her headdress
                        consisted of a frontlet, hanging over the forehead with side pieces and a backpiece, all of gold or imitation and studded with
                        various coloured stones. Her hands were adorned with rings &amp; from one on each finger a chain communicated with a circular
                            <pb n="TYI1123" facs="TYI1123"/><fw>The Young Idea" Saturday 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>February 1858.</fw><cb n="1"
                        /> plate of gold, as also from the bracelets, the back of the hand being thus covered with gold. Her personal appearance was
                        not in the least attractive in fact she looked most remarkably like a monkey dressed up Four musicians accompanied her in her
                        song, which was perfectly unintelligible, altho' good taste was exhibited in the instrumental sound being commanded by the
                        vocal of the musicians two played upon a species of violin supported in a linen band which went round the waist, the bow being
                        handled in much the same manner as a bass viol player would hold it Another had two little brass cymbals about the size of the
                        palm of the hand, which he manipulated with extreme dexterity, and under his able guidance they emitted a pleasant jingling
                        sound. The fourth played on two small drums of curious shape &amp; make suspended round his waist in a linen cloth, and which
                        were played by the action of the fingers &amp; palms of the hand. The costumes of the men were nothing out of the common
                        native dress excepting the nether garments of the "drummer" as we call him, and we heard them very much admired, not only for
                        their pattern, "a pink check":-but for the cut &amp; fit, which would have gained the envy and admiration of all Regent
                        Street, had they been there displayed.</p>
                    <p>The dancing consisted of an advancing &amp; retrograde movement, accompanied with a waving motion of the hands the arms being
                        held in would-be graceful positions over the head, &amp; the feet being occasionally brought together so as to make the
                        anclets strike &amp; jingle. Altogether nothing absurd and vapid ever met our gaze, novelty was its only charm, and we left
                        the room to visit the marriage presents &amp; the celebration of the marriage ceremony.</p>
                    <p>We bent our steps towards the building we have mentioned as attracting our attention from its blaze of light, when we entered.
                        Here we found all the presents arranged for exhibition, amongst which we noticed cup, and trays of solid silver, two handsome
                        enamelled serpent-bracelets studded with diamonds and amethysts, with large rubies in the heads, a necklace of pearls, with
                        emeralds at equidistances: several handsome cachmere shawls, gold rings, linen pieces silver worked vases, and a bedstead of
                        solid sliver, with rose coloured mosquito curtains and a coverlet of Persian workmanship. Wreaths of white flowers were heaped
                        up in a silver bowl, and on a large plate of the same metal small bouquets of flowers were arranged.</p>
                    <p>Close by under a canopy supported by poles of solid silver, sat the bridegroom robed in a splendid shawl, and surrounded by
                        priests in front of him, sat a nautch girl, with her attendant musicians, keeping up a neverending song in Persian and now, we
                        were informed that the ceremony would commence shortly, so we determined to wait and not miss it. Smoking was not considered
                        offensive, so we whiled away the time, scanning &amp; enquiring into the various novelties surrounding us, which excited our
                        curiosity, and which would require the space of a volume to enumerate. The bridegroom appeared to be about 15 years of age and
                        if we might judge by his countenance did not seem to entertain a high notion of the felicity of his situation.</p>
                    <p>We had not long to wait before a change took place. The Bridegroom rose from his luxurious seat and the priests arrayed him in
                        snow white linen garments; he now took his station upon a square piece of sandalwood, painted and ornamented in a pretty
                        device, and squatted down in Hindoo fashion upon his haunches: a very strange looking white turban was not placed on his head
                        and in front of this was fastened a high frontlet, made of worked silver wire (and presenting in a front <cb n="2"/> view, the
                        appearance of a parish beadle's cocked hat), with two enormous tassels depending from each end.</p>
                    <p>He sat, or rather squatted in this position for about half an hour, when the priests again disrobed him and redressed him in
                        red silk leaving the right shoulder &amp; arm bare, again he squatted down, &amp; the large fronlet was removed, &amp; a
                        smaller but similar headdress took its place &amp; the two bracelets I have mentioned before were clasped on his wrists. He
                        now bared his right knee, and his father who was seated on his right hand between two priests, extended his right hand &amp;
                        placed the two forefingers &amp; thumb on his son's knee; at first we were under the impression that he was testing him by
                        introducing some pointed instrument, but as he remained in this position for about ten minutes, we were unable to determine
                        what the intention was. The presents were then shown to him the shawls, rings &amp;c being passed round so his father who held
                        them before him.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after this ceremony the priests, bridegroom &amp; his father rose, and being once more enveloped in the ample folds of
                        the cachmere shawl, he was led away with torchbearers in front, to visit, (as we were informed) the family, &amp; to be
                        introduced for the first time to the bride. During his absence we were decorated with bouquets &amp; wreaths of a sweet
                        smelling white flower, &amp; presented a very gay appearance with our caps and breasts thus adorned.</p>
                    <p>About 20 min. elapsed when the bridegroom reappeared and took his station as before on the square of sandalwood, a similar one
                        was placed opposite to him the bride appeared and squatted down upon it; a voice in the crowd immediately called for "Three
                        Cheers for the Bride" which were heartily given. Poor little thing!!! She had arrived at the mature age of 9 and was already
                        to become a wife. She was dressed in red silk similar to her husband, and a ring through her nose. Think of this! Oh! ye' fair
                        brides of England, but let me inform you that this is a religious custom, &amp; was not placed there for her future husband to
                        make use of to "lead her by the nose".</p>
                    <p>The fingers of her right hand were now entwined with his, and a wreath of flowers bound round them, the holy water of the
                        Ganges was next poured over the joined hands. A gold ring was then placed in the father's hand, who held it in the vessel
                        containing the holy water, and repeated a long unintelligible rigmarole after the priest, after which it was placed on the two
                        joined hands of the young couple &amp; holy water sprinkled over it, Incense was then burnt, the hands separated and the
                        ceremony completed. </p>
                    <p>The happy (?) pair were led off by torchlight. For ourselves, we made it our study to find our garrie and having succeeded
                        after some little trouble, we were speedily borne from this novel and interesting scene, and returned on board heartily
                        pleased with our excursion. </p>

                    <head type="sub"> Match between the Chesapeake &amp; Squadron </head>
                    <p>On Thursday afternoon a Cricket Match took place between the "<orgName ref="#Chesapeake">Chesapeake</orgName>" eleven, and the
                        Squadron eleven, which resulted we are sorry to say in the defeat of the former. The wickets were pitched at 2 P.M. on the
                        ground near <placeName ref="#Ochterlony_Monument">the Ochterbury monument</placeName>, the squadron eleven going into the
                        wickets first. The play was remarkably good, but we consider that the high score made by Mr. <persName ref="#Hope"
                            >Hope</persName> was the cause of the Squadron proving the winners. We must give due credit to them, they played
                        beautifully, and owing to their good fielding, the <orgName ref="#Chesapeake">Chesapeake</orgName>'s were sadly cut up for
                        runs.</p>
                    <p>The <orgName ref="#Chesapeake">Chesapeake</orgName>'s batted much better <pb n="TYI1124" facs="TYI1124"/><fw>The Young Idea
                            Saturday 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>February 1858.</fw><cb n="1"/> than they fielded, indeed, it was a strange fact,
                        that those from whom little was expected, played well and steadily, and did much to the augmentation of the score. They were
                        greatly dispirited at the early overthrow of their best man Mr <persName ref="#Brownrigg">Brownrigg</persName>, who striking
                        at a ball which was pitched high over his head, tipped the ball right into the hands of mid-wicket.</p>
                    <p>The <orgName ref="#Chesapeake">Chesapeake</orgName>'s were very anxious to finish the game (only one innings having been
                        played) by a second innings on the following day, but the squadron, anxious perhaps to retain the victory, appeared unwilling
                        &amp; finally stated that circumstances would prevent them from playing, and they also declined playing this afternoon, much
                        to the <orgName ref="#Chesapeake">Chesapeake</orgName>'s regret.</p>

                    <head> The Theatre </head>
                    <p>On Thursday evening the Amateurs of HMS <orgName ref="#Chesapeake">Chesapeake</orgName> performed for the first time at the
                            <placeName ref="#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName> Lyric Theatre. The Drama performed was <ref rend="new"
                            target="http://victorian.nuigalway.ie/modx/assets/docs/pdf/Vol40ixSeven.pdf">The Seven Clerks" or the Thief &amp; the
                            Denouncer.</ref></p>
                    <p>We cannot speak too highly of the creditable manner in which the performers acted, although a shore going paper has been
                        pleased to insult them, and to cast a baneful shadow over their efforts to please. <ref rend="new"
                            target="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1060150314000060">We only regret that such a splenetic effusion should have ever been
                            permitted to appear in print; the more especially as we consider that jealousy, that greeneyed monster: was the cause of
                            the unwarrantable attack upon the labours of our men.</ref></p>
                    <p>The purely acrimonious composition and illiberal manner in which the several "dramatis personae" are pulled to pieces could not
                        have proceeded from any other source, than that of<cb n="2"/> envy and vexation at the successful result of the entertainment,
                        which the writer who is doubtless a member of the <placeName ref="#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName> Amateur Performers, never
                        before witnessed, when himself and fellow players have acted.</p>
                    <p>But we can afford to take no more notice of him.</p>
                    <p>The Drama was ably supported by the various characters, <persName ref="#George_Horner"/>Geo Horner as the Miser, Claude Darnaud
                        was perfect, and <persName ref="#Henry_Underhill"/>Hy Underhill as Simon Siggel, in the hunger which he so well portrayed,
                        produced a sympathetic feeling, which we were under the necessity of allaying directly the theatre closed. We unfortunately
                        cannot spare the space to bring all of the actors to notice, but it will be enough to say that they gave general satisfaction
                        with the exception of our rancorous friend.</p>
                    <p>The conclusion, the laughable burlesque tragic opera Bombastes Furioso, was ably sustained and to <persName
                            ref="#Henry_Underhill">Henry Underhill</persName> as General Bombastes, we must here give the palm for the inimitable
                        manner in which he carried out his part.</p>
                    <p>The band of the <orgName ref="#Chesapeake">Chesapeake</orgName> attended and contributed largely to the entertainment, a
                        prologue written expressly for the occasion by one of the performers was highly thought of and a hornpipe by Thomas Walsh was
                        enthusiastically encored.</p>
                    <p>We were very glad to see the front circles so well filled, the ladies appearing to enjoy the novel scene, especially, and we
                        may say that the whole passed off most satisfactorily.</p>

                        her wondrous motive power. Once more the fresh sea breezes fan our heated brows, and we feel their invigorating influence;
                        again in the quiet routine of a sea life we can sit down to peruse our latest intelligence from home, to dream over the past,
                        to form conjectures on the future; again we partake of the pleasures of quiescence, after the excitement attendant upon our

                            <p>Much disappointment has been caused by your passing over with so slight a mention, what we have considered one of the
                                principal events in our nautical existence; namely the landing of our Bluejackets, and Marines on the morning of the
                                19th February, for exercise on the <placeName ref="#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName> Esplanade. All performed their part
                                so well, all returned to the ship so pleased at their own performance, that I hope, Mr. Editor you will not consider
                                me too obtrusive if I beg for a little longer notice. Everybody knows that the soul of an Editor is everywhere present
                                and that he sees everything and that nothing can escape his keep observation</p>
                            <p>I will not stop to comment on the glass of medicinal liquid which was served out to us on deck before we started, and
                                which I think they called Quinine Wine, and will only suggest to the Doctor that most of us thought a little drop of

                            <p>Our boats were quickly manned, and no time was lost in reaching the shore, and scrambling up the river's bank. It was
                                but just daylight when we were drawn up in order, and commenced our march along the river side. Our pioneers led the
                                way armed with crowbars, and shovels, under the guidance of two Engineers, and showed that they would be as
                                serviceable in the trenches as in the stoke hole: then came our lively band, which made us step out like men, next the
                                company of Marines (Artillery and Light Infantry), then the Bluejackets in their several Divisions:-like men, I say
                                for however we may admire the mechanical march of drilled soldiers, I hope Bluejackets will always have the free use
                                of their arms and legs.</p>
                            <p>When we arrived on the field of action, our Artillery Companies separated and marched to Fort William to bring out
                                their Field pieces, while we remained exercising in the field: it would weary your readers, Mr. Editor to describe the
                                whole course of our proceedings, how we prepared to resist cavalry, formed into square &amp;c-&amp;c:- suffice it to
                                say that great satisfaction was caused to ourselves, and great wonderment to the native niggers, and we only wished
                                that a few hundred Sepoys were there to practice upon in real earnest. As for the Marine Light Infantry they went
                                right away all over the <cb n="2"/>field and I did not wonder at their having a jolly good run - skirmishing they
                                called it - after being so long penned up on board ship.</p>
                            <p>The "bang, bang", of our field pieces, now drew the attention of all <placeName ref="#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName>
                                upon us, and the fashionable ladies and gentlemen who were out riding, came flocking round us to see so novel a
                                spectacle. The artillery did as beautifully as all the rest of us, and even the small guns worked by small boys, made
                                a very considerable noise on this eventful occasion. But everything must have an end, Mr Editor, so had our field
                                practice, &amp; so also must my letter. See us again drawn up in the line of march, again the lively strains of the
                                "Cheasapeake's" band float over the <placeName ref="#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName> Esplanade, &amp; crowds of Hindoo
                                niggers flock round to see the Regiment of British Tars returning to their "Wooden Walls"</p>
                            <p>It would be unjust not to mention how these wooden walls were guarded in our absence, and how gallantly the Idlers on
                                board prepared to repel boarders in case of invasion:- Those who saw the ship's tailor, doing sentry's duty, with his
                                shears laid aside, and his cutlass girded round him, saw what is not seen every day in Her Majesty's Service.</p>

                    <p>There is nothing spoken, done, written or effected in this world, but the ever ready <pb n="TYI1134" facs="TYI1134"/><fw>The
                            Young Idea" Saturday 6 March 1858.</fw><cb n="1"/>tongue of criticism is prepared to weaken or destroy its effect. We
                        certainly expected that our Amateurs would not come off scatheless, but we were totally unprepared for such an egregious
                        attack as has been made upon them in the Bengal Hurkaru. It was with mingled feelings of astonishment, anger, and amusement we
                        perused the inconsiderate critique upon their endeavours. The whole when carefully weighed forms a "tout ensemble" of the most
                        ridiculous character, and we therefore advise all those who read it to take it in that light, basing their opinions, not
                        merely upon a sentence extracted here and there but upon the general sentiment it contains. It opens with a personal cut at
                        Mr. Van Gelder, thereby evincing that a wish to bring him before the public as a laughing stock, was a prominent feature in
                        the desire to ridicule, which animated the narrow mind, which presumed to judge of our Amateurs performance. The writer then
                        proceeds to state that "he trembled for the fate of those of Neptune's Hardy Sons"—for why? because "the beauty and fashion of
                            <placeName ref="#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName> were present," most likely he imagined the "hardy sons of Neptune" could
                        never stand a battery of bright eyes, however brave when confronting a battery of heavy guns. But we cannot afford space to
                        pull him to pieces in the manner he deserves, but we must notice one thing. The word "Ditchers." such is the very euphonious
                        appellation which the Histrionic Critic of the Hurkaru claims for himself and his copeers of <placeName ref="#Kolkata"
                            >Calcutta</placeName>. We will not now enquire into the origin of the name, but simply observe that such being the title
                        of our assailant, we need not feel surprised to find him such an adept in the art of "flinging mud." We close this article by
                        publishing the Prologue which was read and written expressly for the occasion.</p>

                    <p>The question has often been asked "What caused the Mutiny in India? and is yet often asked. This query has been the subject of
                        much dissertation, and various have been the replies given; still, we fancy public opinion has not received a satisfactory
                        answer. The most universal response (and this we consider to be partially caused by some of the mutineers stating that such
                        had been the incentive) has been, the sepoys fancied their religion was threatened, and that they entertained fears of our
                        intentions to convert them. A very plausible story, certainly, but yet, it does not, to our thinking, bring such force, as
                        that with which we were lately made acquainted.</p>
                    <p>We had the pleasure some days ago, of conversing with two officers, who had belonged to Native Regiments, which were the first
                        to mutiny. In the course of conversation, which concerned the Rebellion, we asked, "what they considered to have been the
                        principal cause?" They both, Simultaneously answered, "a want of proper and efficient discipline."</p>
                    <p>We asked how that could be, as we have always imagined our Indian Forces to have been as well disciplined as English Regiments.
                        The answer was, that they had been for years in a deplorable state, that commanding officers of Regiments, had little or no
                        authority to punish, and that punishments awarded by courts martial, were even set aside, and reprieved by the appeal of the
                        culprit. As an instance, we were informed, that about six months prior to the outbreak, a young English Officer was despatched
                        on detached tudy in command of 200 men, and a native officer<pb n="IMG_1431" facs="TBD"/>When they reached the station they
                        were ordered to occupy, the two companies were told off for their respective barracks, which were built in two parallel rows,
                        each row capable of containing 100 men, and each company was ordered to occupy one. At the order "To your lines, march." both
                        companies made a simultaneous rush, at one of these barracks and began fighting for its occupancy; the bone of contention
                        being its supposed superiority to the other. The Young Officer called his subordinate the native, &amp; [and on and
                        on--ultimately, the British officer had his subordinate and two of the instigators arrested, but those arrested wrote an
                        appeal and were released. The officers telling the story suggest that these men were the first to mutiny and the writer of the
                        piece explains "Can we wonder at the mutiny, when we are made aware of facts like these?"]</p>

                    <p>The remnant of the Ava's wreck, the huts of her officers, and of our own comrades whom we have left on shore the rocks that
                        rise in various spots near the shore, are fast lost sight of as we steam towards Trincomalee.</p>
                    <p>Pigeon Island itself, on which our eyes have so long rested, recedes from our view, as we come in sight of the Rocky eminence
                        and flagstaff of Fort Frederick. The shore behind it is low, with a deep fringe of palms and cocoa huts along the sandy beach
                        and low, round, treeclad hills, behind them. But the Rock itself stands out bold and rugged, advancing, isolated, into the
                        sea, reddish in hue, with only scanty bushes springing from among the crevices, the signal staff rising high on the summit,
                        with two or three guns, and some low buildings beside it, which we believe to be the Soldier's Hospital</p>
                    <p>As we round the Rock, we see more buildings belonging to the Fort, and more protecting guns; While the Village of Trincomalee,
                        standing amidst palm trees on the level plain rapidly came into sight; it is a pretty picture.</p>
                    <p>We see obelisks rising among the bushes at the Cemetery, various colonnaded houses, partly concealed<pb n="IMG_1439" facs="TBD"
                        />by trees, humbler dwellings of the natives, overshadowed by palm trees; a few dark figures, crossing the common that
                        intervenes between the village &amp; the sea. Then a rough rocky promontory meets our view, with small rounded hills, clothed
                        with wild trees and bushes down to the waters' edge. We wind our way round it, and see a harbour opening before us with smooth
                        water receding in various directions among the green, bush covered hills. There is a rough eminence to our right with a small
                        fort on the summit, and a low rocky point jutting out beneath, armed wtih two or three guns. Still we wind round it; we lose
                        sight of the open sea, and the water seems everywhere landlocked, in ever direction there are the low, rocky, but bushy hills,
                        with the bright blue water running into the various windings &amp; inlets, which seem to be interminable.</p>
                    <p>We have so wound our way in that we are now at the very back of Fort Frederick, and we see its flagstaff in the distance rising
                        right ahead of us, we are abreast of the little Dock Yard, and here for a time we are made fast to the shore, to coal, and our
                        ship rests in perfect stillness.</p>

                    <head>A trip to Sober Island</head>
                    <p>We shoved off from the ship about 4 P.M. in the gig with as good a crew as we could possibly have desired, Men who had
                        evidently made up their minds to a good pull, and to enjoy themselves, and whose merry laughter gave evidence to the universal
                        good humour which prevailed amongst all; in fact a merrier, and (we must say) a noisier crew, we have rarely met with. Under
                        the influence of a long stroke the boat shot rapidly along, our men pulled capitally, when as the island was neared, they
                        evinced a decided determination to admire the scenery which delighted the eye on every side, instead of rowing, and they
                        required some stirring up from those who performed the more pleasant task of steering, to give way the required distance, but
                        as the landing place broke upon their sight a hearty cheer escaped from their lips and they plied their oars so vigorously
                        that we began to entertain fears that the oars would be broken. However we got safely to land, and having made fast the boat,

                        the discovery of a respectable European house, which was inhabited by a magistrate that was hearing a court case for arson.
                        The magistrate then acquaints the Chesapeake men about the impossibility of learning the truth about this. Very detailed

                        fiddle or the horn. The smartest sailor is often the best dancer, &amp; he who has worked hardest with his hands by day, will
                        be the nimblest on his feet by night. In the hard work that has been done this week, stripping the<pb n="IMG_1465"

                    <p>[...]Rumour speaks strongly of our near departure from Trincomalie for the Red Sea; on account of the recent massacre of the
                        European population of Jeddah: the change will no doubt be pleasant for a short time, whilst we are enjoying the novelty of

                    <p>Our present stay in Trincomalee harbour, has bidden fair to terminate with scenes far less peaceful than those with which it
                        commenced. Sticks have been prepared, revolvers loaded, and threats passed to &amp; fro between some of ourselves on board and
                        our dusky Gentoo neighbours on the shore. WE must honestly confess, that the first offence seems to have proeeded from some of
                        our own bluejackets too anxious to pry into Gentoo mysteries, and interrupt the nocturnal procession of the natives in honor
                        of their "idol deities"; this led to a wanton attack, the following night upon two of our own officers in uniform.</p>
                    <p>British blood rose against such an insult, and on the following night it was avenged by a little band of Crusaders, who
                        stormed, and cleared the heathen temple of its worshippers. More desperate vengeance is now threatened by the natives for itis
                        the nature of vengeance thus to propagate itself; but we would hope that here it may end.</p>
                    <p>While we admire the true English spirit, which has led our youthful Crusaders, to view a mob of infuriated "niggers" with more
                        indifference, than they would the same number of cats, or monkeys, we would yet hope, that no unnecessary animosity may be
                            raised,<pb n="IMG_1470l" facs="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7843/47482467781_da64f0bebd_k_d.jpg"/>and that in our
                        dealing as Christians, with these Gentoo natives, we may be guided always by a spirit of compassion, &amp; kindness, rather
                        than one of oppression, &amp; contempt.<note>Bampfield's extracts include the initial "B" at the end of this

                            characters.</note></head>
                    <p>On Friday night the 27th Inst our amateurs provided us with a first rate evenings amusement The Quarter deck was gaily
                        decorated with flags and flowers, and presented a beautiful spectacle, the utmost credit being due to the managers and
                        arrangers of the decorations, we have not space to give a lengthy description of the arrangements, but we cannot refrain from
                        giving the actors that praise which is most justly their due. The pieces chosen were well suited to the various talents of the
                        actors. <persName ref="#George_Horner">Geo Horner</persName> as "King Charles the 2nd looked and acted the "Merry Monarch"
                        well, and <persName ref="#Charles_Stewart">Chas. Stewart</persName> did equally well in the character of Rochester. But no
                        doubt Captain Copp the kind hearted old sailor (<persName ref="#Thomas_Walsh">Thos. Walshe</persName>) was the life and soul
                        of the piece, and kept us in roars of laugher with his quaint sayings whenever he made his appearance. Lady Clara (<persName
                            ref="#John_Hurst">John Hurst</persName>) looked the lady well, but spoke timidly, and Mary (<persName ref="#James_Hammond"
                            >Jas Hammond</persName>) also required a little more self confidence</p>
                    <p>In the second piece "Raising the Wind", the part of "Jeremy Didler" was ably sustained by <persName ref="#Isaac_Wright">Isaac
                            Wright</persName>, and Fainwould" the simple cockney was admirably impersonated by <persName ref="#Charles_Stewart">Chas.
                            Stewart</persName>, indeed this appeared to us the most perfect impersonation of the Evening. The greatest credit is also
                        due to <persName ref="#William_Connell">Wm Connell</persName> for the way in which he played the lady's part of Miss Laurelia
                        Durable, this appears to be his particular forte. <persName ref="#Thomas_Walsh">Thos. Walshe</persName> again shone as "Sam
                        'the waiter, and the minor characters also did wel. Seldom have we seen an audience so well pleased or actors so well
                        applauded. The "jig" by <persName ref="#Thomas_Walsh">Thos Walshe</persName> was as excellent as usual, and the "Yo heave oh!"
                        sung by <persName ref="#William_Connell">Wm Connell</persName> produced a pleasing effect by the Chorus which it raised from
                        the Blue jackets present.</p>
                    <p>After the play, the Quarter Deck was cleared &amp; a few couples were formed for dancing. A large number of visitors were on
                        board, and we believe very much enjoyed the Evening's entertainment. The Gun Room gave a capital spread despite their want of
                        space &amp; means to their brother officers of the "Pelorus"</p>

                    <p>Our readers are aware that a Telegram had been received reporting an outbreak at Trincomalie, in which it was stated that two
                        officers of the "Chesapeake" had been assaulted by the native Gentoos, and one of them badly wounded, and that General
                        Plainclothes had landed his forces, and punished the natives for their temerity. Since then despatches have been received and
                        we are indebted to the authorities at the Horse Guards, for permission to publish the same. </p>
                    <p>long description of how the "General" gathered and ordered his troops [seems to me very much playing at being like the Pearl,
                        who formed brigades to put down the mutiny--there are admiring accounts of their heroism in The Young Idea. Hopping ahead to
                        when things escalate-the series of letters need to be encoded as a shift in the formatting...I can wait to do that until
                        later, though...the various letters are meant to be various reports from commanding officers]</p>
                    <p>Not wishing my forces to scatter, I ordered the recall to be sounded &amp; the Brigades mustered, when Capt James was reported
                        missing, search was immediately made, &amp; in a short time he was found at the upper end of the temple senseless &amp;
                        bleeding. The temple was now set on fire, &amp; the interior devoted to destruction, the brigades doing great execution among
                        the Gilt &amp; otherwise richly ornamented Elephants, gods, cars &amp; Peacocks, but the only Trophy brought on board was an
                        Elephants Tusk, having committed as much injury as possible, I ordered a retreat, sending 1st Co of the Light Brigade under
                        Ensign B.L. Zeebub to see the road clear, &amp; boats ready. The Natives seeing us retreating and their temple burning, came
                        out with yells, but did not approach us, &amp; the retreat was quietly effected.</p>
                    <p>I have great pleasure in making honorable mention of a gallant act performed Lieut. Furze HB; during the embarcation Private
                        Jaunting fell off the pier head, upon which Lt Furze jumped overboard &amp; swam to his assistance, thereby saving his life.
                        Pte Jaunting not being able to swim I should hope that Lt. Furze may be deemed worthy of the Victoria Cross, as also Corpl
                        Judy, who under a heavy fire carried Capt James on his back from the scene of action.</p>
                    <p>I am happy to state that the wounded are doing well, 3 men only being wounded severely, &amp; I must take this opportunity of
                        calling to your Highness' notice the prompt &amp; gallant way in which all my orders were executed, &amp; the steadiness of
                        both officers &amp; men under the heavy fire, of the enemy, as well as the valuable assistance rendered me by Genl. Gander who
                        was severely wounded on this occasion; &amp; I beg to forward to you herewith a return of the forced engaged (Enclosure No 2)

                    <p>The last week has seen a great change come o'er our arrangements; destined for Calcutta, already anticipating the sweets of
                        Diamond Harbour, enjoying our visit to Madras, and quite secure from thoughts of sailing, except in a Northerly direction, we
                        have been suddenly disturbed, and all our propsitions overthrown by a Telegram from the Senior Officer ordering us off to
                        Aden</p>
                    <p>Altho' we saw a possibility of such an order, and even expected it, which laying in the peaceful harbour of Trincomalee, when
                        first the intelligence of the massacre at Jeddah arrived, still we had dispelled the idea during the intervening fortnight,
                        and the order for us to repoir thither was as unexpected as it was sudden.</p>
                    <p>We have heard that the "Cyclops," having been fired upon at Jeddah, has totally destroyed the Forts, so that we shall have
                        little or no work to do there</p>
                    <p>We are not sorry that we are called to another part of the station, for we hope to find fresh matter of interest, &amp;
                        amuseument for our columns, and in the shores<pb n="1472l"/>of the Red Sea, so familiar to us thro' biblical, and ancient
                        records, such cannot be wanting.</p>
                    <p>All must be glad to hear that the endeavour to lay down the Atlantic Telegraph has at last met with the success, the mighty
                        scheme deserved. England, &amp; America are now linked together, &amp; tho' separated by the vast Atlantic, the ingenuity of
                        man, aided by Providence, has overcome space, time, &amp; every obstacle, &amp; words, &amp; thoughts can now be exchanged,
                        with an inconceivable rapidity</p>
                    <note>it must be noted that the conflict at Jeddah escalated primarily because directions sent to the Captain of the Cyclops were
                        not received before he decided to bombard Jeddah--a massive miscommunication resulted.</note>

                    <p>Dear Sir<lb/>The lucid despatches of General Plainclothes have already put vividly before the public the night assault on the
                        Gentoo Temple, and the triumph of the British Crusaders. But of the causes which led to that assault, namely the cowardly
                        attack made on the previous Evening on an officer in Naval Uniform little has yet been said. I propose therefore to sketch
                        from memory, so far as my skill enables me, the scene which I accidentally witnessed on that Evening, but in which
                        fortunately, I was no participator.</p>
                    <p>I had sauntered down from the Esplanade and the tents of the Cricketers, &amp; was proceeding towards the jetty to procure a
                        canoe, when my attention was aroused by the loud tomtoming, the jingling of bells, &amp; other discordant sounds which
                        proceeded from the vicinity of the Gentoo temple. On entering the green compound in which the temple stands I found the whole
                        space blazing with light, and crowded with Gentoo worshippers, dressed in their gayest attire, evidently keeping a festival in
                        honor of some deity or deities; I know not whom, most probably, some local deities who are supposed to preside over the sacred
                        spot. A grand procession was advancing round the compound, flambeaux bearers in great numbers led the way, musicians followed,
                        playing upon strange discordant instruments, which, all unmisical as they were to my ears, would produce, I doubt not, a
                        pleasing, as well as, an exciting effect upon the minds of a barbarous, or semicultivated people. Nay! I even thought that
                        such perchance, or nearly such, might have been the music spoken of in such sweet strains by the Psalmists of ancient Israel.
                        The three chief instruments were, as well as I could see them, a long shrill clarionet of wood ornamented with brass, a sort
                        of small flageolet, not straight but curved, and a sort of bagpipe played by the pressure of the arm, but without holes,
                        emitting only a dull oozing sound that never varied. The effect of the three combined exceedingly resembled that of our
                        celebrated Highland instrument, but the Musicians ran up &amp; down the holes in wild discordant strains, without an attempt
                        as it seemed to me, at anything resembling a musical air. </p>
                    <p>Small tom toms, beat in at both ends, and one large one beaten on one side only, conch shells blown at intervals, with hoarse,
                        braying sound, a steel bar, slung &amp; beaten by a smaller one, after the fasion of the European triangles, and little bells
                        jangling in various parts of the procession, all added to the wild music that rose &amp; fell upon the night breezes. After
                        the musicians came the Nautch girl, the Brahmin priest, &amp; the sacred shrine of the deities The Nautch girl was richly
                        attired, &amp; laded with gold, &amp; jewelled ornaments: the Brahmin a fat, oily man of much lighter hue than the surrounding
                        worshippers, wore upon his head a beautiful chaplet of pearls, but otherwise was bare to the waist; both he and the Nautch
                        Girl kept their faces twined towards the shrine, advancing with backward step. Keeping up a low murmuring chant, bowing their
                        bodies, and waving their arms with graceful motion. The shrine itself was rich &amp; gorgeous, borne upon the heads of
                        numerous dark bearers: the back of it rose, I suppose to the height of 12 feet tripartite, the centre division rising higher
                        than the other two, from this a painted peacock projected, its gorgeously colored tail spreading far, &amp; wide, with a large
                        gilt idol seated on its back. Two smaller idols occupied the two side divisions, gilt like the other, but without the
                        supporting bird: over all three, tall canopies rose, about 18 feet high, shaped like an umbrella, and painted bright red. The
                        whole was illuminated by lofty banners hung with little lamps, &amp; I think with small bells intermixed. Hundreds of dark
                        natives decorated with gay turbans of white, and gilt joined in the procession, swelling at intervals the low chant of the
                        Brahmin &amp; gazing with adoration on the Idol gods. In front of the native houses, where the procession passed, little
                        offerings to the gods were exhibited, chiefly, it appeared to me, dishes of bread &amp; salt. Altogether I must confess it was
                        one of the most striking, if not the most pleasing spectacles I have ever witnessed, reminding one strongly of the religious
                        processions in the South of Europe; the general effect was most imposing, while the bright moonlight shining over groves of
                        Palm trees added solemnity to the surrounding scene.</p>
                    <p>The dark Gentoo worshippers, so far from expressing any signs of aversion to our being present at the spectacle, seemed rather
                        to greet us with smiles as they passed the spot where we were standing. As the gorgeous shrine moved on to reenter the temple,
                        Lieut. Nelson<note>Bampfield does not include a specific name in his transcription, instead referring to "Lieut. W__"</note>
                        and two or three of our younger Companions moved with the crowd, hoping to catch a sight<pb n="1475l"

                        already entered the outer enclosure, &amp; were about approaching the vestibule of the temple, (a temporary shed thatched with
                        palm leaves), when, as I understand they were warned not to infringe in the part appropriated to the women. On this they moved
                        to the other side, only catching a glimpse thro' the open gate of the illuminatted interior of the temple, with its white
                        pilasters and sacred carved Elephant. To their surprize they now found themselves violently &amp; ferociously attacked by a
                        large party of men armed with sticks. "Had I attempted to attack them in return" says Lieut Nelson, "I should most probably
                        not have come back alive." With difficulty they retired, all more or less injured. Relying on the interference of the police
                        authorities, I deprecated any hostile demonstration in return, &amp; restrained a party of bluejackets who were running down
                        to the spot from rushing in to attack the natives. How little redress could be obtained from the Court of Justice, I believe
                        is now well known, &amp; few will regret that under the able guidance of our respect Genl Plainclothes, the insult to a
                        British officer was, on the following Evening, so speedily visited with just retribution. Believe me to be Dear Sir Yours
                        Sincerely "Spectator"</p>

                    <p>We left our ship, a large party of us, in three Boats at half past 8 a.m., and after various difficulties in avoiding coral
                        rocks, and crossing shoal Water, came alongside the Jetty near the Southern extremity of the Town. Here we perceived the
                        KaimaKhan, or Governor of Jeddah dressed in purple uniform coat, and attended by the Harbour Master in his suit of brown
                        cloth, waiting to receive us. He shook each one by the hand as we ascended the steps &amp; Passing under the gateway, found a
                        number of Arab steeds in gay trappings, &amp; saddles, ready for us to mount. We formed a brilliant cavalcade, as we set out
                        on our progress thro' the town. We were 20 in all, and all attired in our uniform frock coats &amp; swords with white flowing
                        turbans encircling our caps. Captains Pullen, and Parkin led the way, attended by the Kaima Khan, while we followed by twos
                        and threes, and well armed Turkish attendants, Bashi Bazouks we believe with plenty of silver mounted pistols at their girdles
                        welked at our horses heads. After passing an open space in which loungers were sitting smoking hookahs, and drinking coffee,
                        &amp; camels lying wiht piles of goods around them, our road lay thro' the long winding streets of the Bazaars, where articles
                        of every description were exposed for Sale, &amp; human faces of every shape and color met the view. There was so much novelty
                        to attract the eye; that it was difficult to notice anything occurately. The Bazaars were so narrow that two horsemen could
                        with difficulty ride abreast, without pushing against the wares on either side. In some parts swarms of flies rendered our
                        progress annoying. There were broad vessels piled up with dates, or melons, or pomegranates, or oranges; trays on which large
                        broad cakes, or other eatables were exposed for sale. shops in which the porous water coolers, and other simple earthenwares
                        were hangingin, or silks and muslins of various kinds, or strings of breads, amber black or white coral or cornelian, such as

                    <p>Our Christmas play came off in right merry style on Wednesday Evening (29 Decr). Our quarter deck, roofed in with flags of all
                        nations, presented as gay a Theatre as one would wish to see, while the rising tiers of benches from the deck to the bridge
                        abaft, accommodated a large and happy audience, not only of our own bluejackets, but of those from the "<orgName

                    <p>We are proud of our Amateur Performers, who have this time surpassed themselves. The comedy of King Charles the Second" being
                        cast as on the last occasion, we need say little, except to compliment the fair "<persName ref="#James_Hammond"

                        which she plays her part. "<persName ref="#George_Horner">Charles</persName>" was as royal, "<persName ref="#Charles_Stewart"
                            >Rochester</persName>" as Manly, and old "<persName ref="#Thomas_Walsh">Copp</persName>" as jolly hearted as ever.</p>
                    <p>The two farces which followed kept the audience in a state of continual laughter and applause. <persName ref="#Thomas_Walsh"

                        with a song, and a "jig" which brought down thunders of applause. The other characters of the piece were all good, but "Widow
                        Leary" the landlady deserves special mention. She was the yielding widow, and the Irish landlady is perfection.</p>
                    <p>In the "Man about Town" the chief burden of the piece rested upon <persName ref="#Isaac_Wright">Isaac Wright</persName> as
                        "Skirts", and well did he sustain it. Coming in which his two large placards of the "Learned Pig," he at once moved our mucles
                        to a state of risibility, which we found it difficult to pause from, such was the continued succession of funny deeds, and
                        speeches. <persName ref="#George_Horner">Horner</persName> as "Dr Mandible" the physician, <persName ref="#Thomas_Walsh"
                            >Walsh</persName> as "Topps" the Tiger, and indeed all the minor characters, played up to him well, and the curtain fell
                        amidst loud and long applause.</p>
                    <p>We may safely say that all Oficers &amp; men present, whether French or English, were delighted with their Evening's amusement,
                        and we were glad to observe our newly arrived Commodore, tho' rather late or the first piece, thoroughly enjoying the fun of

                        <p>A tardy act of justice has at length been accomplished, and two of the prime instigators of the "Jeddah Massacre" have paid
                            with their lives the penalty of their murderous deed. We know not who may have been those Eleven wretched Arabs, who on a
                            former occasion were executed on the reefs in the sight of the "Cyclops"; but at all events they were but the tools, the
                            instruments of the crime; the origin of it has been clearly traced home to the three chief men in Jeddah, those whose duty
                            it was to protect, and defend the Christians, and strangers who felt secure in their friends help.</p>
                        <p>Horrible as was the sight of blood on Wednesday morning, we must rejoice as Englishmen, that justice has found out its true
                            victims; the third guilty man, the late Kaima Khan of Jeddah, is, we hear to be sent to Constantinople, to await the
                            Sultan's decree, &amp; tho' we have sipped his coffee, &amp; smoked his pipes, we can scarcely regret that he too should
                            meet with a like fate. To the firmness of the French Commissioner, we believe this act of just retriubution may be
                            attributed. Bombardment or the execu<pb n="TYI2052"

                            alternatives offered, and Namik Pacha, at the last moment, with grief &amp; reluctance signed their death warrant.</p>
                        <p>We may now perhaps consider that the first great objects of the Jeddah Commission, &amp; of our own visit here, has been
                            accomplished, &amp; tho we hear that much still remains to be settled, in the way of indemnification, yet we would indulge
                            a hope that the presence of the Chesapeake may be no longer necessary. This very morning, the "Duchayla" has spread her
                            wings again, and is now speeding on her way to Suez tho', we believe to return again: let us hope that soon we may have to
                            record how the "Chesapeake" also has let fall her long-furled canvass, &amp; is far on her way to Aden &amp; the waters of
                            the East.</p>

                                <opener>To the Editor of the "Young Idea"<lb/>Dear Sir,</opener>
                                <p>As one of those whose duty it was to witness the Execution on Wednesday last (12th), I beg to send you some slight
                                    account of what took place, tho' indeed I write even now with a feeling of horror at the spectacle At 4 am, as you
                                    know, we were all astir, coffee being served out to the Marines and Boats' crews who were to attend. At One Bell
                                    we shoved off from the ship, and it still wanted some time to daylight when we mustered, under Captain Seymour's
                                    orders, abreast of the old Turkish hulk whihc is lying off the town. The "<orgName ref="#Pelorus"
                                        >Pelorus</orgName>"' Boats were there and those of the "Ducayla" a goodly squadron in all, three Pinnaces,
                                    besides several cutters, and two or three light gigs. The Pinnaces each carried their brass gun in the bows, and
                                    all the Boat's crews were well provided with arms, and ammunition in case of any sudden outbreak of the natives.
                                    As daylight broke over the walls and minarets of Jeddah, and the more distant hills that bound our landscape to
                                    the Eastward, we started from our "rendezvous," the execution being fixed by the Turkish authorities for one hour
                                    after daybreak. The Frenchmen led the way, the Boats following one another in single file; it took us fully half
                                    an hour to reach the shore, the pilotage among the shoals being difficult, and by the time that all arrangments
                                    were complete, the "one hour after daybreak" was fast expiring. We found the Turkish guard already drawn up at the
                                    scene of execution; it was the square plot of ground on the Custom House Wharf, open to the shipping, and close
                                    under the seawall of the town. As we stood facing the sea, the right side of the square was occupied by a company
                                    of Turkish soldiers, perhaps 100 in number, a similar company of Albanians occupied the left; while a third side
                                    was formed of the English Marines &amp; French Sailors, each fifty in number, with their backs against the wall of
                                    the town. The French occupied the right of our position, their right thus touching the plank of the Turks, and
                                    between us waved, side by side, the flags of our two countries, those flags which had been dishonoured, &amp;<pb

                                    fearful night of the Christian massacre. It wasa picturesque sight, though we stood in shadow, there were the
                                    Turks in their red Fez caps, dark brown jackets, with red pipings and black accoutrements, muskets with long
                                    shining barrels, the men themselves of fair height but somewhat dingy, and dirty looking. There were the
                                    Albanians, light in hue, tall and dressed in white, white jacket, and white loose trousers, white cap with tassel,
                                    white ose, white bells, a red sas only relieving the unmixed white of their costume; there werre our own in their
                                    blue and red Tunics (for half were Artillery, and half Light Infantry), and their white forage caps; there were
                                    the French Sailors, in their blue jackets, and white trousers with red sash, and straw sailors hat, armed with
                                    rifle and sword bayonet, while on the seaside, completing the square, were drawn up a single line of Bashi Bazouks
                                    &amp; irregular Albanians, dressed in a strange variety of costume armed to the teeth with pistols, swords,
                                    daggers, and knives, and of every hue &amp; shade of complexion, some jet black, others light, and fair. Behind
                                    all were seen our boats, with their respective crews moored in line a boat's length from the shore, their sterns
                                    towards the Quay</p>
                                <p>Our attention was now turned to a gateway in that corner of the Square on which the right of the Albanians rested.
                                    It was the gateway leading into the town, adorned with open partico, that projected into the square. From this, as
                                    soon as we had formed, guards were despatched to bring in the two prisoners. Everything was still; no inhabitants
                                    of the town were to be seen or heard, except the few Turkish Officials who stood on the town wall behind us, or
                                    looked from the windows of a house that commanded the Square. All approaches to the spot were closed, and guarded
                                    by Turkish sentries </p>
                                <p>But see!!! the prisoners approach and on them every eye is fixed.</p>
                                <p>The first one who entered is an old man thin, and spare, dressed in light green robe flowing to the feet, and white
                                    turban; his beard white with age, his eye keen and piercing. His hands were tied behind, above the elbows, and he
                                    is attended by a guard on either side, and a third behind; he halts on entering the square, and looks astonished.
                                    I can well believe the story that is told that he knew not his approaching fate till that moment he casts his eyes
                                    around, and as they rest on our "colours" he seems to comprehend all, and gives himself up to prayer. He is
                                    followed at a short interval by the other prisoner, similarly guarded; a taller and apparently a younger man, with
                                    robe of dark purple, and white Turban; his hands similarly tied, he is we understand the sheikh of that Arab tribe
                                    which committed the massacre, while the older man is the "Chief of Bazaars" the richest and most powerful man in
                                    Jeddah. As they seem to hesitate by the gateway, they are pushed on by the guard into the cenre of the square and
                                    there they are compelled to kneel down with their faces turned Eastward, towards Mecca. The guards retire, the
                                    executioners take their place with sword drawn; wild looking fellows, irregular Albanians, their arms bare to the
                                    elbow, their sashes loaded wiht pistols. The old man is the first to suffer: as he bends his head forward, the
                                    executioner seems to try his distance carefully with the sword, two or three times; -yet his first blow strikes
                                    too low down the back: again the sword is raised, and the blow falls on the neck but does not enter deeply; the
                                    old man who is still murmering in prayer, turns his head, as though reproachfully; a third blow is struck, and he
                                    falls forward on his face; the gush of blood seems to choke his utterance: his last words of prayer, gurgle out
                                    with his lifeblood, but the head is not yet severed; it is butcher's work that follows: the remaining flesh is
                                    sawn through with the sword, and the head rolled away from the body: a pool of blood rushed out upon the ground,
                                    the executioner lifts the robe of the deceased, and wipes in it his sword and bloodstained fingers.</p>
                                <p>I could look no longer: a sickening sensation came over me: one of the French Sailors, a powerful man, fainted
                                    away: I saw not the second execution; the gleam only of a decending sword seemed to flash before my eyes, and in
                                    another moment, I heared that all was over: the head of the second prisoner had been severed at a single blow.</p>
                                <pb n="TYI2054"/>
                                <p>The Turkish authorities now advanced and flung over each of the bodies a white sheet; but this made the seem almost
                                    more ghastly than before, for you could see the blood spouting from the arteries against the underside of the
                                    sheet, and with each gush dying it afresh.</p>
                                <p>I was only too glad when the order was given to leave this scene of blood &amp; reembark in our boats. I am sure
                                    that not one of those who saw it woudl ever with to witness such another scene</p>

                        <p>Only the total absence of all circumstances of note, has for a while, caused our weekly sheet to remain unstained with ink;
                            our pen to be useuless on the desk before us. "The Young Idea" professes to record events, not to invent fiction; but here
                            at Jeddah the record of one day, is a history of the whole: nothing has occurred to vary our monotony, except the hasty
                            visit of our little messenger the "Roebuck."</p>
                        <p>We could almost envy them the fitful way in which they flit from place to place, pausing only for a day, or two at each
                            station; from Jeddah to Suez, or from Aden to Jeddah: they have shivered for a while in the real winter's cold of Egypt;
                            they have wandered through the Oriental Streets, and Bazaars of crowded Cairo; they have gazed on the green valley of the
                            fertilizing Nile; they have climbed to the summit of the Great Pyramid, and penetrated into its close, and half
                            suffocating chambers, and we, all the while, have been idly lying amongst the reefs of Jeddah, our minds gleaning no fresh
                            idea from scenes before us, but wandering vacantly into the future or the past.</p>

                            unchequered by a single occurrence of note, unmarked by a single episode, wehreby they may be remembered;- productive of
                            naught to interest, amuse, or cheer on such a stagnant state of affairs no wonder that ideas become tainted with dulness
                            and that imaginiation is entirely at a loss to provide amusement.</p>
                        <p>But we cannot let this, our last week at Jeddah pass, without commemorating our release from its influence wihtout hailing
