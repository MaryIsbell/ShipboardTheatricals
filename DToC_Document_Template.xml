                    <!-- don't forget to format this as a letter...just transcribing the body for now -->
                    <p>On Wednesday the 9th a grand dinner party was given by the Ward Room Officers of H.M.S. Chesapeake to their commodore, in honor
                        of his having on that day hoisted his Broad Pendant</p>
                    <pb n="IMG_1406l.JPG" facs="___"/>
                    <p>I will not encroach too much on your valuable time, by entering fully into minute details, but proceed to describe, as well,
                        and briefly, as I am able, one of the great features of the week. There is little occasion to name the Bill of Fare, as it
                        might make sundry people's mouths water to no purpose; suffice it to say the table was served in a most
                        "recherche<!-- the e is accented -->" style; the good looking and well dressed sailor boys, being remarkably attentive; the
                        whole being under the able management of Mr. Geo Hoadley, the Mess Steward.</p>
                    <p>Scandal, says, that several cries were heard from the background, much resembling the noise that boys make when under
                        punishment, and therefore avers, that the boys' good conduct arose from the fact of a Corporal, having been seen to enter the
                        ward room previous to dinner, with what sailors call a "persuader" in his hand. But as I make it a practice to turn a deaf ear
                        to scandal, (altho' readers may draw their own conclusions) still I am of opinion that they (the boys) have been too well
                        drilled, and the system too good, to allow such a derogatory report to gain ground in any right minded person's opinion. You
                        must pardon me, for having thus digressed from my subject, but as calumnious reports quickly get abroad, and such an one might
                        prove detrimental to that well regulated mess. I take this opportunity of nipping it in the bud: -to proceed:-The culinary
                        department, under the care of Mons: do Blanchearde, (who bids fair to outrival Mr Soyer) gave every satisfaction and the well
                        satisfied look that rested on everyone's face, on the removal of the cloth, would, could he only have seen it, have repaid him
                        well for his unremitting zeal.</p>
                    <p>Dessert on the table, and the glasses filled, the usual loyal toast was drunk to the splendid band of the ship, under their
                        leader, Signor Faustine, playing "God save the Queen" followed immediately by "The return of the Admiral". Some slight mistake
                        appears to have been made, in the time appointed for the playing of this Air; but to the fact of the Bandmaster being a
                        foreigner, and as yet, not initiated into English customs, must this mistake be attributed</p>
                    <p>After the strains of music had ceased the President Capt. Piers, in an appropriate speech proposed the health of Commodore
                        Watson CB which was drunk with enthusiasm, and no heel tops <note>"no heel tops" is a call made when one has not emptied their
                            glass after a toast</note>, the band playing as before, the "Return of the Admiral" ...</p>

                    <!-- I don't understand why these individual paragraphs
                    get an xml id. it might be functionality I don't need, but I'll leave it to see how it transforms. Oh, I actually think this is
                    labeling things with a specific tag that will show up in the index? This is what Anna would use to create her narrative blocks,
                    but I won't really need it for the things I'm tagging, since I'm tagging individual words or phrases, not entire paragraphs (at
                    this point) and my tags really just need to be revealed through the list of tags. The header here does not specific that only TEI
                    tags are available, which allows me to create my own. There are many fewer restrictions here, which is helpful in teaching xml
                    separate from TEI. Actually, I can use the subsection functionality. It will actually help me create a more detailed index because
                    it will show which types of contributions are in each issue. It will allow me to create a list of these types of contributions in
                    the index (while the table of contents will show everything in the proper order, displaying the headings, I think)-->
