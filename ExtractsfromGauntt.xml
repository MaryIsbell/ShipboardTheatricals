         <div type="narrative">
            <p>...</p>
            <p>I again visited Washington, and was ordered, July 10th. 1818, to join my old ship the Macedonian I proceeded to the Navy Yard
               Charleston, Massachusetts, where the ship lay fitting out for a three years' cruise to the Pacific Ocean, and reported, 19th. July, to
               Captain Downes for duty.[list of the officers of the Macedonian, not transcribing now <pb n="20"/>...] Officers and crew in number
               422.</p>
            <p>The equipment of the Macedonian was completed September the 19th. and on Sunday the 20th. 1818, we sailed from Boston with a fine
               breeze from W. S. W.</p>
            <p>On the 27th. of September, Latitude 36&#176; N. Longtitude 56&#176; W. we were dismasted in a hurricane--during the
               night it blew immoderately, causing a heavy mountainous sea--at 5 o'clock in the morning the mizen mast fell, carrying with it three
               fine boats; besides which, by 7 o'clock, we lost, by force of the wind, every sail, and every spar, except the bowsprit and fore and
               main masts, which were badly sprung. During the gale life lines were rove fore and aft to enable the officers and crew to keep their
               footing upon the decks--no human voice could be heard above the storm, so fiercely did the wind rage that to communicate an order it
               was necessary to give it in a subdued, instead of a loud, voice close to the ear of the seaman. The hull remained tight and sound, but
               the ship was otherwise a complete wreck. We lost overboard the captain of the mizen top--the life buoy was cut adrift, but no human aid
               could avail him: the poor fellow was abandoned to his fate</p>
            <pb n="21"/>
            <p>At meridian of the 28th. the gale abated to which may be ascribed our escape from foundering; for our situation was at one time
               exceedingly dangerous. All hands were now employed rigging jury-masts, and preparing the ship to return to port. Norfolk, Virginia,
               being the most convenient place, at which to refit, we directed our course thither, where we arrived, and anchored off the Navy Yard,
               October the 10th.</p>
            <p>Our refit being complete, on the 6th. of November we sailed from Norfolk, and received three hearty cheers from the inhabitants as we
               passed the Town. On the 5th. December we saw the Island St Jago, one of the cape de Verds, saw also the Island Fuego, of the same
               group. We crossed the Equator December the 12th, at the 25th. degree of west longitude, and met with light airs and calms, and rain and
               frequent light<del>e</del>ning. Dad Neptune, with his wife Amphitrite, and their retinue, came on board, and went through the usual
               ceremonies of crossing the Line--a visit much better omitted than observed, on board a man of war.</p>
            <p>You will see, my sons, by what follows, that the crew of the Macedonian were not without their amuseuments.</p>
            <p>Written hand bills were distributed about the ship, giving notice that, on the evening of Christmas, a play, called the Weathercock,
               with an after piece entitled the Sailor's Fortune, would be performed: the author-<pb n="22"/>ship of the latter piece was claimed by
               D.C.B. carpenter's yeoman of the frigate. By permission of Captain Downs, the play and farce were acted, affording a novel treat to the
               officers and crew of the ship.</p>
            <p>On new year evening, the play of the Weathercock was again performed, after which we were entertained with the Cobbler and his
               Daughter, interspersed with songs &amp;, the whole got up, and the farce written, by our indefatigable <hi>author</hi> and
                  <hi>actor</hi> D.C.B. carpenter's yeoman. A criticism of the whole performance appeared in the Thespian Critic and Theatrical
               Review, a paper written and edited on board by some of the crew--of which the following is a copy.</p>
         </div>
         <div source="Thespian_Critic" type="quotation">
            <head>THE THESPIAN CRITIC AND THEATRICAL REVIEW.</head>
            <fw>No. 2--vol. I. JANUARY 2nd. 1819. 12 1/2 cents single.</fw>
            <head type="sub">THEATRICAL</head>
            <p>The Thespian Theatre was opened last evening for the second time, with the following entertainment of the Weathercock--and the Cobbler
               and his Daughter; Tristram by Mr. D.C.B. from the Theatre Royal. As expectation is always on tipto<add>e</add> at the <hi>debut</hi> of
               a new performer, and his merits and demerits occasion much animadversion, we have taken the trouble of minutely observing this new
               performer's beginning to give our <pb n="23"/>friends an impartial account of him; and we must say that our expectations were much
               disappointed, particularly with regard to his tautology and his gesticulation.</p>
            <p>In act 1st scene 1st, for saying "did you never hear of Demosthenes the Athenean orator &amp;," he repeats, did you never hear of
               De--mo--thens the A--the--an orator--certainly the most vulgar pronunciation. In his next speech of "I think I see him now awaking
               &amp;," his gesticulations were so violent that it reminded us of a frantic bedlamite, and seemed possessed with the idea that the more
               noise there was, the more admirable his performance. Again he says "one soul a--ni--ha--mates &amp;, for animates, Where he picked this
               jargon, or whether in his deep researches after literature, he conceives he has found a more correct manner of pronounciation than his
               contemporaries Johnson or Walker, we must leave the public to judge. Again, while conversing with Sneer, (Mr. Williams of the fore
               top,) to personate Juliet in saying "Oh that I were a glove upon that hand &amp;," his grimace is so intolerable, that it was painful
               to observe him; and he either forgot or was ignorant that, in addressing Juliet, he ought to have bended one knee; but no, with his
               finger pointed as if to command silence of his Juliet that she may hear his rhapsody: But of all the canting, noisey Billingsgate
               slang, his speech of a Soldier, a General &amp;, is made to represent to a hair: his eyes<pb n="24"/>roll, his chest is extended, his
               limbs compressed into the form of the letter S, and he makes the whole house tremble while he wars it out, and at intervals, bellowing
               like a child crying for a piece of bread and butter; but when he takes his sword--then comes the tug of war, and he fancies that
               admiration sits on every countenance, and he dances from one end of the stage to the other like a dancing bear. Again--in the scene
               between Tristram and the gardener--for "vile habilaments," he repeats--vile ha--bit--a--ments--what he means, no one could form an
               idea, unless it was by the action of throwing off his clothes; but enough for the present. We could point out a number of other
               material instances of defect; but hope that these will infuse into him a wish to correct his manners and pronounciation.</p>
            <p>Old Fickle by Franey, steerage servant<note>A steerage servant is a servant in the steerage, preparing meals and generally caring for
                  midshipment, or young officers in training. This is unique position in a ship because the steerage servant is likely well-known to
                  these young officers, but is not equal to them. This person is also not working alongside the able-bodied seamen (though he may be
                  bunking with them in separate quarters). The most important thing to note is that this performer gets kind criticism--it would seem
                  the reviewer knows him. This suggests that the reviewer was a midshipman</note>, a veteran--on the whole were much entertained by
               him and the performance of the character, though we hope he will be rather less forgetful on another night; and we sincerely believe
               that he will be a valuable acquisition to our Theatre.</p>
            <p>Miss Variella, by Williams of the carpenter's crew, --"grace in all <hi>her</hi>steps, heaven in <hi>her</hi> eye, in every gesture
               dignity and love."</p>
            <p>Briefwit, Mr. H, as stiff a piece mechanism and greater than the author intended him I dare say, for he was both briefwit and
               briefless. Sneer Mr. W with a<pb n="25"/>little improvement will do well in those characters. The piece went off without either many
               marks of approbation or disapprobation, and we hope that the piece will not be resumed without some attention being paid to the errors
               and defects pointed out.</p>
            <p>The Pantomime was so wretchedly performed that even the name of it would have been incomprehensible, unless we had seen it in the play
               bills.</p>
            <p>The songs were however, very well, but the subject too pointed; though we believe unintentionally so by the author. We were glad to see
               a full house on the commencement, as, without that, the expense could not be continued. We saw the side boxes were filled with Naval
               Heroes--some of distinction and rank. We have been thus particular with the faults of Mr. D.C.B., not with the wish to dishearten him;
               but to lead him to improvement, that he may thereby reap the reward of his exertion and talents.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="narrative">
            <p>About this time an opposition paper appeared called the "Macedonian Scourge," --the following remarks are taken from paper No. 7.</p>
         </div>
         <div source="Macedonian_Scourge" type="quotation">
            <head><hi>Editorial</hi></head>
            <p>The Editor of this paper is really sorry that the remarks contained in his paper of January the third should have been of such a nature
               as to draw forth the "ire" of the gentleman who heads the Thespian Band. That a gentleman of his qualifications should have recourse to
               caricature for the purpose of defaming <pb n="26"/>him, (who would be the last to injure the Thespian Throng,) is really astonishing.
               With pleasure do we appeal to an enlightened public for an opinion of the following, which was made with no other view than to maintain
               the dignity of the stage, and that lustre which spreads it refulgent beams around the personage of this modern Othello,</p>
            <p>Theatrical Entertainment, January 2nd. 1819. Last evening the crew of the Macedonian frigate were politely favoured with a rich repast
               of Theatrical labour in the display of the Weathercock, and a pantomime of the Cobbler and his Daughter. We hope our subscribers will
               excuse us for a digression from our accustomed mode of issuing this paper in noticing the <hi>Dramatis Personae</hi> of those
               celebrated pieces. Tristram, that most important part of the Weathercock, was assigned to the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>acquired</hi>
               abilities of Mr. David C. Bunnel, who has for a length of time appeared with so much honor to himself, and advantage to the community,
               upon the Theatres of the Congress and Macedonian frigates. He is not, however, without his imperfections, and in reminding him of them,
               we have not only the stage at heart; but that of his own welfare on the stage, and that to which he may be translated.</p>
            <p>In the part which relates to his having arrived to the acme of perfection in the study of the Law, and the learned speech which he
               makes to prove that he possesses that<pb n="27"/> fund of knowledge, we discover that his pronounciation is totally incorrect, as he
               differs from Johnson, Walker, and others. In pronouncing Demosthenes, he says "De--mo--thens, which must be disgusting to those who are
               familiar with pointing and diction. In another part he says the Ane--than instead of the Athenean Orator. We hope that he will make it
               his study to repair the damages done to the King's English by a proper adherence to the rules of pronounciation, in order that the
               brilliancy of his Theatrical abilities may not be tinged by imperfection which require little or no gumption to remove. </p>
            <p>in regard to "Williams" of the fore top, we doubt not but that he possesses more assurance than generally falls to the lot of mankind.
               It is not within the compass of our power to conceive what it was that actuated Williams to embark in that line of life, for which he
               has neither earthly or heavenly capacity; and we are at a loss to know what will cause him to recede from that line of life which ruins
               his judgement, and consigns his reputation to merited contempt and just indignation.</p>
            <p>In regard to old Fickle, great allowances should be made. A little of that <hi>twang</hi> which seems to be forced more than natural,
               should give way for more ease and elegance in pronounciation, together with a more retentive memory, that recourse need not be had to
               written papers in presence of the audience.</p>
            <p>Great credit is due to the unwearied exertions of<pb n="28"/> "Fanigan," who has been zealously employed in getting up the scenery
               &amp; &amp;. One gross mistake however, caught our eye as soon as we entered the room, which was a Turkey Buzzard substituted for the
               American coat of arms: without this, the scenery was in every respect complete.</p>
            <p>"Goodfellow," whom it seems is a new hand at the bellows, did not more than rise to mediocrity: But his articulation at the time
               Tristram discovers him in the capacity of a gardener, gave evident proof of his being likely to prove a great acquisition to the
               Thespian Band.</p>
            <p>Briefwit, alias Horton of the fore top, was both dull and tedious. Tameness was perceivable in every gesture, which may be attributed
               to his being totally unaquainted with the Latin tongue, which which his part abounded. Let the Manager hereafter be cautious how he
               disposes of those parts of the play on which depend solely the merit or demerit of the performers.</p>
            <p>Variella was immeasurably disgusting. Her appearance denoted a girl who had been rioting in all the pleasures which fancy could bestow
               from her earliest infancy, with a countenance which denied all shame, and which had not felt a blush since she entered her teens; she
               labored through her part without the least display of any thing like gesture or simplicity of manner which would even have caused the
               spectators of an inverted comedy to smile.</p>
            <pb n="29"/>
            <p>In taking a retrospect of the whole, we cannot say that it crowns every thing that was ever presented to our view, If these gentle
               admonitions should be of any avail, we will be foremost in noticing it after the next performance; but if the reverse, we shall
               continue to hold them up as subjects of severe criticism, and exclaim that we have not nor shall we ne'er look upon their like
               again."</p>
