                  <note>Reverend John William Lewis Bampfield joined the Chesapeake on July 24th 1857 and was a regular contributor to and supporter
                     of The Young Idea. While his age is not recorded in the muster book, census records reveal that Bampfield was born in June of
                     1823, so he was in his mid-thirties during the cruise. He was commissioned as chaplain aboard a different royal naval vessel in
                     Port Royal, Jamaica before his arrival aboard the Chesapeake. His detailed journal provides an additional witness to The Young
                     Idea, providing fascinating points of contrast from the facsimile edition that McArthur had printed in 1867 and offering hints
                     about the authorship of contributions through his inclusion of the initials of authors (a marked list).</note>

                  <note>Harry Edmund Edgell joined the Chesapeake as Commodore after the period chronicled in the issues included in this edition. He
                     was an enthusiastic supporter of The Young Idea. In <hi rend="italics">Martello Tower" in China, and the Pacific in H.M.S.
                        "Tribune," 1856-60</hi>, Francis Martin Norman recounts Edgell's enthusiastic support for a shipboard theatrical aboard H.M.S.
                     Tribune in 1857, when he was captain of the ship. Edgell composed the prologue for the play and painted the drop-scene (50). The
                     National Maritime Museum at Greenwich (NMM) holds over 300 watercolors by Edgell, including some undertaken during the cruise
                     chronicled in The Young Idea. The NMM's biographical note on Edgell reads as follows: "Edgell was promoted to lieutenant in 1828,
                     to commander in 1837 and to captain in 1846. He was appointed to command the Tribune in 1855 when she was in the Crimea. During
                     this commission she went to the Pacific and finally to China. In 1857 Edgell was the Senior Naval Officer at Hong Kong and he
                     transferred into the Bittern tender commanding the gun boats on the Canton River during the hostilities with the Chinese. In 1858
                     be was given command of the squadron in Indian waters, during which time he commanded the Chesapeake and later the Retribution.
                     The latter returned to England and was paid off in 1860. Edgell had no further active employment and was promoted on the retired
                     list, reaching the rank of vice-admiral in 1871."</note>

                           <bibl><title>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</title></bibl>: <quote>"Watson, Rundle Burges (1809–1860), naval
                        officer, was the eldest son of Captain Joshua Rowley Watson (1772–1810). He entered the navy in November 1821, and was
                        promoted lieutenant on 7 October 1829. [...] On 23 December 1842 he was advanced to post rank, and on 24 December was made a
                        CB. [...] In December 1852 [Watson] was appointed to the new steam frigate Impérieuse (50 guns), then, and for some years
                        later, considered one of the finest ships in the navy. In 1854 she was sent into the Baltic in advance of the fleet, Watson
                        being senior officer of the squadron of small vessels appointed to watch the breaking up of the ice, and to see that no
                        Russian warships got to sea. It was an arduous service well performed. The Impérieuse continued with the flying squadron in
                        the Baltic during the campaigns of 1854 and 1855, and until the signing of peace in March 1856. As the senior officer of the
                        frigate squadron, and generally on detached service, Watson demonstrated the highest standards of seamanship, judgement, and
                        leadership. After the peace the Impérieuse was sent to the North American station; she returned to England and was paid off
                        early in 1857. From May 1856 until his death Watson was naval aide-de-camp to the queen. In June 1859 he was appointed
                        captain-superintendent of Sheerness Dockyard, where he died on 5 July 1860. An officer of great ability, Watson was one of the
                        last great sailing-ship captains, and the first frigate captain of the steam era."</quote></note>

                        proceeded MA in 1836. After taking orders he was appointed through the influence of Daniel Wilson, bishop of Calcutta, a
                        chaplain of the East India Company in 1838. He became Wilson's domestic chaplain and in 1850 archdeacon of

                     with a depth in the hold of 23 feet 11 inches. As Lyon and Winfield explain, "Corvette designs were rapidly enlarged over the
                     1860s, as the corvette began to take over the traditional role of policing the high seas. To this end they were all built as
                     steam auxiliaries, designed to cruise under sail" (207). HMS Pelorus was broken up for parts at Devonport on February 3, 1869.

                  well. But no doubt Capt Copp, the kind-hearted old Sailor (Thos Walshe) was the life and soul of the piece, &amp; kept us in roars
                  of laughter with his quaint sayings whenever he made his appearance. "Lady Clara" looked the lady well, but spoke timidly, and
                  "mary" alas required a little more confidence. In the 2nd Piece "Raising the Wind," the part of "Jeremy Didler" was ably sustained
                  by <gap reason="illegible"/> Wright, &amp; "Fainwould" the simple cockney was admirably impersonated by Chs Stewart. Great credit is

                  forte. Thos Walshe again shone as "Sam" the Yorkshire waiter and the minor characters also did well. Seldome have we seen an

                  with flags and flowers, and presented a beautiful spectacle, the utmost credit being due to the managers and arrangers of the
                  decorations, we hav enot space to give a lengthy description of the arrangeents, but we cannot refrain from giving the actors that
                  praise which is most justly their due. The pieces chosen were well suited to the various talents of the actors. Geo Horner as "King
                  Charles the 2nd looked and acted the "Merry Monarch" well, and Chas. Stewart did equally well in the character of Rochester. But no
                  doubt Captain Copp the kind hearted old sailor (Thos . Walshe) was the life and soul of the piece, and kept us in roars of laugher
                  with his quaint sayings shenever he made his appearance. Lady Clara (John Hurst) looked the lady well, but spoke timidly, and Mary
                  Jas Hammond) also required a little more self confidence</p>
               <p>In the second piece "Raising the Wind", the part of "Jeremy Didler" was ably sustained by Isaac Wright, and Fainwould" the simple
                  cockney was admirably impersonated by Chas. Stewart, indeed this appeared to us the most perfect impersonation of the Evening. The
                  greatest credit is also due to Wm Connell for the way in which he played the lady's part of Miss Laurelia Durable, this appears to
                  be his particular forte. Thos. Walshe again shone as "Sam 'the waiter, and the minor characters also did wel. Seldom have we seen an
                  audience so well pleased or actors so well applauded. The "jig" by Thos Walshe was as excellent as usual, and the "Yo heave oh!"
                  sung by Wm Connell produced a pleasing effect by the Chorus whihc it raised from the Blue jackets present.</p> -->
