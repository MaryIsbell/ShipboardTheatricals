                        <note>Reverend John William Lewis Bampfield joined the Chesapeake on July 24th 1857 and was a regular contributor to and
                            supporter of The Young Idea. While his age is not recorded in the muster book, census records reveal that Bampfield was
                            born in June of 1823, so he was in his mid-thirties during the cruise. He was commissioned as chaplain aboard a different
                            royal naval vessel in Port Royal, Jamaica before his arrival aboard the Chesapeake. His detailed journal provides an
                            additional witness to The Young Idea, providing fascinating points of contrast from the facsimile edition that McArthur
                            had printed in 1867 and offering hints about the authorship of contributions through his inclusion of the initials of
                            authors (a marked list).</note>

                        <note>Harry Edmund Edgell joined the Chesapeake as Commodore after the period chronicled in the issues included in this
                            edition. He was an enthusiastic supporter of The Young Idea. In <hi rend="italics">Martello Tower" in China, and the
                                Pacific in H.M.S. "Tribune," 1856-60</hi>, Francis Martin Norman recounts Edgell's enthusiastic support for a
                            shipboard theatrical aboard H.M.S. Tribune in 1857, when he was captain of the ship. Edgell composed the prologue for the
                            play and painted the drop-scene (50). The National Maritime Museum at Greenwich (NMM) holds over 300 watercolors by
                            Edgell, including some undertaken during the cruise chronicled in The Young Idea. The NMM's biographical note on Edgell
                            reads as follows: "Edgell was promoted to lieutenant in 1828, to commander in 1837 and to captain in 1846. He was
                            appointed to command the Tribune in 1855 when she was in the Crimea. During this commission she went to the Pacific and
                            finally to China. In 1857 Edgell was the Senior Naval Officer at Hong Kong and he transferred into the Bittern tender
                            commanding the gun boats on the Canton River during the hostilities with the Chinese. In 1858 be was given command of the
                            squadron in Indian waters, during which time he commanded the Chesapeake and later the Retribution. The latter returned to
                            England and was paid off in 1860. Edgell had no further active employment and was promoted on the retired list, reaching
                            the rank of vice-admiral in 1871."</note>

                                naval officer, was the eldest son of Captain Joshua Rowley Watson (1772–1810). He entered the navy in November 1821,
                                and was promoted lieutenant on 7 October 1829. [...] On 23 December 1842 he was advanced to post rank, and on 24
                                December was made a CB. [...] In December 1852 [Watson] was appointed to the new steam frigate Impérieuse (50 guns),
                                then, and for some years later, considered one of the finest ships in the navy. In 1854 she was sent into the Baltic
                                in advance of the fleet, Watson being senior officer of the squadron of small vessels appointed to watch the breaking
                                up of the ice, and to see that no Russian warships got to sea. It was an arduous service well performed. The
                                Impérieuse continued with the flying squadron in the Baltic during the campaigns of 1854 and 1855, and until the
                                signing of peace in March 1856. As the senior officer of the frigate squadron, and generally on detached service,
                                Watson demonstrated the highest standards of seamanship, judgement, and leadership. After the peace the Impérieuse was
                                sent to the North American station; she returned to England and was paid off early in 1857. From May 1856 until his
                                death Watson was naval aide-de-camp to the queen. In June 1859 he was appointed captain-superintendent of Sheerness
                                Dockyard, where he died on 5 July 1860. An officer of great ability, Watson was one of the last great sailing-ship
                                captains, and the first frigate captain of the steam era."</quote></note>

                            at the broadest point, with a depth in the hold of 23 feet 11 inches. As Lyon and Winfield explain, "Corvette designs were

                            this end they were all built as steam auxiliaries, designed to cruise under sail" (207). HMS Pelorus was broken up for

                    <!-- don't forget to format this as a letter...just transcribing the body for now -->
                    <p>On Wednesday the 9th a grand dinner party was given by the Ward Room Officers of H.M.S. Chesapeake to their commodore, in honor of
                        his having on that day hoisted his Broad Pendant</p>
                    <pb n="IMG_1406l.JPG"/>
                    <p>I will not encroach too much on your valuable time, by entering fully into minute details, but proceed to describe, as well, and
                        briefly, as I am able, one of the great features of the week. There is little occasion to name the Bill of Fare, as it might make
                        sundry people's mouths water to no purpose; suffice it to say the table was served in a most "recherche<!-- the e is accented -->"
                        style; the good looking and well dressed sailor boys, being remarkably attentive; the whole being under the able management of Mr.
                        Geo Hoadley, the Mess Steward.</p>
                    <p>Scandal, says, that several cries were heard from the background, much resembling the noise that boys make when under punishment,
                        and therefore avers, that the boys' good conduct arose from the fact of a Corporal, having been seen to enter the ward room previous
                        to dinner, with what sailors call a "persuader" in his hand. But as I make it a practice to turn a deaf ear to scandal, (altho'
                        readers may draw their own conclusions) still I am of opinion that they (the boys) have been too well drilled, and the system too
                        good, to allow such a derogatory report to gain ground in any right minded person's opinion. You must pardon me, for having thus
                        digressed from my subject, but as calumnious reports quickly get abroad, and such an one might prove detrimental to that well
                        regulated mess. I take this opportunity of nipping it in the bud: -to proceed:-The culinary department, under the care of Mons: do
                        Blanchearde, (who bids fair to outrival Mr Soyer) gave every satisfaction and the well satisfied look that rested on everyone's
                        face, on the removal of the cloth, would, could he only have seen it, have repaid him well for his unremitting zeal.</p>
                    <p>Dessert on the table, and the glasses filled, the usual loyal toast was drunk to the splendid band of the ship, under their leader,
                        Signor Faustine, playing "God save the Queen" followed immediately by "The return of the Admiral". Some slight mistake appears to
                        have been made, in the time appointed for the playing of this Air; but to the fact of the Bandmaster being a foreigner, and as yet,
                        not initiated into English customs, must this mistake be attributed</p>
                    <p>After the strains of music had ceased the President Capt. Piers, in an appropriate speech proposed the health of Commodore Watson CB
                        which was drunk with enthusiasm, and no heel tops <note>"no heel tops" is a call made when one has not emptied their glass after a
                            toast</note>, the band playing as before, the "Return of the Admiral" ...</p>
