                  <note>HMS Pelorus was a Royal Navy screw corvette with twenty-one guns in the Pearl class. She was launched on February 5, 1858 and
                     her masting and fitting-out was completed on September 10, 1857. She was 200 feet long, 40 feet 4 inches at the broadest point,
                     with a depth in the hold of 23 feet 11 inches. As Lyon and Winfield explain, "Corvette designs were rapidly enlarged over the
                     1860s, as the corvette began to take over the traditional role of policing the high seas. To this end they were all built as
                     steam auxiliaries, designed to cruise under sail" (207). HMS Pelorus was broken up for parts at Devonport on February 3, 1869.

               Written hand bills were distributed about the ship this afternoon, giving notice that a play called the "Weather Cock," with an after
               piece <emph>entitled</emph> the Sailor's Fortune, would be performed in the evening. The author<pb n="16"/>Authorship of the latter
               piece, is claimed by David C. Bunnel, Carpenter's Yeoman of the Macedonian, who, having previously obtained permission of our
               Commander, and assisted by a few of his shipmates, had got up the aforenamed pieces for the treble purpose of, in the first place,
               giving amusement to the Officers &amp; crew of the ship, Secondly, <add>of</add>his <emph>faculties</emph> or <emph>powers</emph> of
               the mind, as an Author, and Thirdly, to show his <emph>merit</emph> as an Actor, in all of which, except the former, he failed most
               egregiously. Every necessary preparation being made, the Curtain rose at 7 <emph rend="superscript">o</emph>Clock, when the Play was
               commenced, <emph>middled</emph> and ended, so was teh Farce, and, to say a great deal in a few words, the Audiences were treated with
               the combined talent of the <emph>Crew</emph> of the Macedonian, the Officers laughed heartily, and were much amused with the novelty of
               the scene. every encouragement, consistent with the discipline of the Ship, will be given towards promoting this species of amuseument;
               it has, I think, a tendency to create contentment among the crew, which is of some consideration, when it is known, that we are bound
               on a cruise of three years.</p>

            <p>On New Years evening the Play of the "Weathercock" was again performed, with the afterpiece called the "Cob<add>b</add>ler &amp; his
               daughter," with songs &amp; the whole got up and the farce written, by our indefatigable <emph>author</emph> &amp; <emph>actor</emph>
               David C. Bunnel (carpenter's Yeoman) for the information of those who may chance to read these remarks, as well as to please my own
               fancy, I herein copy from the "Thespian Critic and Theatrical Review"' (a paper edited &amp; written on board) the following criticism
               of the play above mentioned.<quote><p><emph>Theatrical_January 2d 1819.</emph><lb/>The Thespian Theatre was opened last evening for the
                     second time with teh following entertainment of the Weathercock and the Cob<add>b</add>ler &amp; his Daughter. Tristram by Mr
                     D.G.B. from the Theatre Royal. As expectation is always on tiptoe at the debut of a new performer, &amp; his merits or demerits
                     occasion much animadversion, we have taken teh troubel of minutely observing this new Performer's commencement to give our
                     friends an impartial account of him; and we must say, that our expectations were much disappointed, particularly so with regard
                     to his tautology &amp; his gesticulation. In act 1st Scene 1st for saying did You never hear of Demosthenes the Athenian Orator
                     &amp;c he repeats "did you never hear of De_mo_thens the A_the_an orator_certainly the most vulgar pronunciation_In his next
                     speech of_"I think I see him now awaking"_his gesticulations were so violent that it reminded us of a frantic Bedlamite, and
                     seemed [unreadable] with teh idea that the more noise there was, the more admirable<pb n="19"/>ble his performance._again he
                     says_one soul "a_ni_ha_mates &amp;c for animates_where he picked this jargon, or whether in his deep researches after literature,
                     he conceives he has found a more correct manner of pronunciation than his cotemporaries_Johnson or Walker, we must leave the
                     Public to judge_again while conversing with Sneer (<emph>Mr</emph> Williams) to personate Juliet, in saying Oh that I were a
                     glove upon that hand &amp;c his grimace is so intolerable that it was painful to observe him and he either forgot or was ignorant
                     that in addressing Juliet, he ought to have bended one knee_but no, he stood half bent, with one arm extended, &amp; the other
                     with his finger pointed as if to command silence of his Juliet that she may hear his rhapsody. _But of all the canting noisey
                     Billingsgate slang, his speech of A soldier, a General &amp;c &amp;c is made to represent it to a hair._His eyes roll, his chest
                     is extended, his limbs compressed into the form of a letter S and he makes the whole house tremble while he wars it out_and at
                     intervals, bellowing like a child crying for a piece of bread and butter; but when he takes his sword_then_then comes the tug of
                     war, and he fancies that admiration sits on every countenance, and he dances from one end of the stage to the other like a
                     dancing Bear._Again_ in the scene between Tristram &amp; the Gardener,_for vile Habiliments he repeats_Vile Ha_bit_a_ments. What
                     he meant no one could form an idea, unless it was by the action of throwing off his<pb n="20"/>his clothes._but enough for the
                     present, we could point out a number of other material instances of defect; but hope that these will suffuse into him a wish to
                     correct his manners and pronunciation_</p><p>Old Fickle by <del>M</del> Franey, (steerage servant) a veteran_ on the whole, we
                     were much entertained by him &amp; the performance of the character, <del>pretty well</del> &amp; though we hope, he will be
                     rather less forgetful on another night; and we sincerely believe, that he will be a valuable acquisition to our
                     Theatre_</p><p>Miss Variella, by Williams (of the Carpenters crew) "grace in all <emph>her</emph> steps, Heaven in her eye, In
                     every gesture, dignity and love."_</p><p>Briefwit, <emph>Mr</emph> H. <del>as</del>a stiff <del>a</del> piece of machinery &amp;
                     greater than the author intended I dare say, for he was both Briefwit and Briefless. Sneer, <emph>Mr</emph> Williams, with a
                     little improvement will do well in the characters_ The piece went off without either many marks of approbation or disapprobation,
                     and we hope, that the piece will not be resumed without some attention being paid to the errors &amp; defects pointed
                     out.</p><p>The Pantomime was so wretchedly performed, that even the name of it would have been incomprehensible, unless we had
                     seen it in the Play Bills_</p><p>The songs were, however, very well, but the subject of some were too pointed, tho we believe
                     unintentionally so by the Author._ We were glad to see a full house on the commencement, as without that, the expense could not
                        be<pb n="21"/> be continued,_We saw the side Boxes were filled wtih the Naval Heroes_some of distinction &amp; rank_ We have
                     been thus particular with the faults of <emph>Mr</emph> D.C.B. not with the wish to dihearten him, but to lead him to
                     improvement, that he may thereby reap the reward of his exertion &amp; talents &amp; we sincerely hope he may_"</p></quote></p>
            <p>About this time, an opposition Paper appeared, called the "Macedonian Scourge," The following remarks are taken from Paper No.
                  7_<emph>Editorial</emph>_<quote><p>"The Editor of this paper is really sorry that the remarks contained in his paper of January the
                     third, should have been of such a nature as to draw forth the "Ire" of the gentleman who heads the Thespian Band, That a
                     gentleman of his qualifications should have recourse to caricature for the purpose of defaming him (who would be the last to
                     injure the Thespian Throng,) is really astonishing_ With pleasure do we appeal to an enlightened Public for an opinion of the
                     following, which was made with no other view than to maintain the dignity of the stage, and that lustre which spreads it
                     refulgent beams around the personage of this Modern Othello."_</p></quote></p>
            <p><quote><p><emph>"Theatrical Entertainment Jany 2d 1819"</emph><lb/>Last Evening the crew of the Macedonian frigate were politely
                     favoured with a rich repast of Theatrical labour in the display of the "Weathercock" and a Pantomime of teh Cobbler &amp; his
                     Daughter_ We hope our Subscribers will excuse us for a digression from our accustomed mode of issuing this paper in noticing the
                     "Dramatis Personae" of those celebrated pieces,_Tristram,that most imp<pb n="22"/>important part of the Weathercock, was assigned
                     to the <emph>Natural</emph> and <emph>acquired</emph>abilities of <emph>Mr</emph> David C. Bunnel, who has for a length of time
                     appeared, with so much honor to himself and advantage to the community, upon the Theatre of the Congress and Macedonian Frigates.
                     He is not however, without his imperfections, and in reminding him of them, we have not only the reputation of teh stage at
                     heart, but that of his own welfare on this stage, and that to which he may be translated. In that part which relates to his
                     having arrived to the acme of perfection in the study of the Law, and the learned speech which he makes to prove that he
                     possesses that fund of knowledge, we discover that his pronunciation is totally incorrect, as he differs from Johnson, Walker
                     &amp; others, In pronouncing Demosthenes, he says Demosthenes, which must be disgusting to those who are familiar with pointing
                     and diction</p><p>In another part he says the Ane_than instead ofthe Athenean Orator, We hope that he will make it his study to
                     repair the damages done to the King's English</p></quote></p>
