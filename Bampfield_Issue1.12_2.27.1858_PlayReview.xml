            <!-- The
                                "Calcutta Lyric Theatre," as it is grandly called is but a poor
                                building, constructed entirely of bamboos &amp; palm-leaf staffing.
                                Standing as it does, in the Esplanade, under the shadow of the
                                Ochterbury Monument, &amp; in sight of the Government House, &amp;
                                other magnificent buildings, it looks a deal more like some country
                                    <del>farm</del> barn or temporary shed, <gap
                                    reason="indecipherable"/> a permanent temple of the Muses. We
                                should conclude, &amp; rightly, that the Calcutta people are not
                                admitted to public Evening amusements, &amp; are fonder of resting
                                at home after the business of the day than of venturing abroad to
                                the venue of histrionic efforts.<lb/>Taking this circumstance into
                                consideration, we were glad to see so fair an audience assembled
                                together on Thursday evening to witness the first performance of the
                                "Sailors from the Chesapeake." The Theatre, on entering is far from
                                unpleasing in appearance; the decorations of painted canvas,
                                assisted by the lighted lamps, gave to it an air of decided taste
                                and beauty, which on the present occasion was heightened by the
                                female faces, dark &amp; fair, who occupied the front circle of
                                raised seats. The little semicircular box was chiefly filled by
                                Naval Officers from the Chesapeake, and a select number of our own
                                Bluejackets. The Orchestra contained the Chesapeake band, which if
                                somewhat too noisy from the predominance of brass instruments, at
                                least contributed much to the pleasure of the Evening. The "Royal"
                                Box, in the center of the raised seats, was on this occasion
                                occupied by Commodore Watson, &amp; other patrons of the
                                entertainment, on whose entrance the audience rose, the Band playing
                                our National Anthem. <lb/>But we must now speak of our Actors &amp;
                                give the Dramatis Personae, &amp; the names of those who sustained
                                them.<lb/>"The Seven Clerks Dramatis Personae" <lb/>"The Seven

                                "Seven Clerks", a legend of Marseilles, was admirably revised to
                                develop the various talents of the actors. Geo Horner, as the old
                                Miser, sustained his tragic part most admirably, while St Underhill,
                                as Simon Siggel, in the hunger which he so well pourtrayed, not only
                                called down roars of laughter from the house, but produced a
                                sympathetic feeling, which we were under the necessity of allaying
                                directly the Theatre closed. J. Walshe, as the Dutch Robber, was
                                very clever, &amp; Isaac Wright as the English robber from S. Giles,
                                was no less droll. Great credit also must be given to <choice>

                                </choice> Connell, who maintained the 2 characters around which the
                                others centered, namely those of Adolphe, &amp; Victorine. Stewart
                                spoke nobly &amp; manfully, &amp; Connell looked and spoke the
                                woman's part, with a grace &amp; tenderness we cd scarcely expect.
                                The various tableaux, &amp; short strains of music, with which the
                                Drama is interspersed, were very pleasing. <lb/>The Nautical

                                given us by Wm Connell:-but the Calcutta audience were well pleased,
                                both with the dance &amp; song. <lb/>In "Bombastes Furioso," we will
                                content ourselves by saying that all sustained their parts
                                admirably, &amp; that roars of laughter resounded thro' the house.
                                As this was the first time that our Chesapeake Amateurs have
                                appeared before a public audience, we must say that the highest
                                credit is due. <lb/>We close our notice by publishing the excellent
                                Prologue, by Henry Montagu, which was written expressly for this
                                occasion, &amp; spoken by him before the Curtain rose.
                                <lb/>Prologue By Hy Montagu <lb/>Friends, Patrons of the "Thespian"
                                art; I stand, <lb/>as spokesman for our little stage-struck band;
                                <lb/>I come kind friends, respectfully to pray <lb/>Indulgent smiles
                                for this our little play <lb/>Think not that we aspire to win a
                                "Name" <lb/>In the high path of Histrionic fame: <lb/>Or that misled
                                by fierce dramatic rage, <lb/>We hope like "Lear" to strut upon the
                                stage: <lb/>No 'tis the aim of our most <del>humble</del> modest
                                Muse <lb/>To please our patrons, and ourselves amuse, <lb/>Just
                                this, no more, as Amateurs we come <lb/>Let this avowal strike the
                                critics dumb. <lb/>Tonight, then, if our humble skill avails <lb/>We
                                represent a legend of "Marseilles" <lb/>"Bombastes," next with love
                                and fame elate, <lb/>Shall claim your laughter and your mirth
                                create: <lb/>Joy, pathos, fun, e'en murder's sanguine strain
                                <lb/>Mingle and follow in our motley train <lb/>Thus at the
                                "Clerk's" sad fate, droops pity's eye, <lb/>Yet "Simon's" suppers,
                                funds of mirth supply, <lb/>With horror "Darnaud's" vices now regard
                                <lb/>And yield to Adolpho's love its due reward <lb/>Then comes
                                "Bombastes" may he please you all <lb/>And may you laugh until the
                                curtain fall <lb/>Well, then, my friends, scare not our sailor's
                                muse <lb/>Nor to our first trial, applause refuse, <lb/>So shall our
                                tread each moment firmer grow <lb/>And the dramatic fire more warmly
                                glow. <lb/>Encourage this our unfledg'd wings first flight
                                <lb/>We'll strive and please you more another night, <lb/>With
                                grateful pride, I cast around my gaze <lb/>And see a host of varied
                                beauty blaze <lb/>Soft beaming eyes, sweet lips, in smiles arrayed
                                <lb/>Which might have well Herculean toils repaid <lb/>Their praise

                                rage, <lb/>Anxious to "strut their hour" upon the stage. <lb/>And
