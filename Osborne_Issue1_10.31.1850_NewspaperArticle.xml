            <p><hi>T</hi>HE Intrepid Royal Saloon was on Thursday honored with the presence of the principal personages in these realms.</p>
            <p>The performances consisted of a series of songs, sung by accomplished Vocalists, and a pathetic recitation or two, ao admirably delivered, as to cause all the handkerchieds to be put in requisition, that had not previously been stolen by sone loose characters at the door, who had <cb/>suceeded in gaining admittance notwithstanding the vigilance of our active police force_ All the arrangements were admirably carried out, and the company separated at a late hour, highly gratified with their evening's amusement_ We hope the good example thus shown, will be followed by the other Ships of the Arctic Squadron, and although a "floe" exists between us, we shall always be happy to contribute our mite towards forwarding such a derirable object._</p>
