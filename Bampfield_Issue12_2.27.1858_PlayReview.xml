            <p>The"Calcuta Lyric Theatre", as it is grandly called is but a poor building, constructed entirely of bamboo &amp; palm leaf staffing. Standing as it does in the Esplanade, under the shadow of the Ochterbury Monument, &amp; in sight of the Government House, &amp; other magnificent buildings, it looks a deal <!-- individual? --> more like some country <del><gap reason = "indecipherable"></gap></del> <!-- This is like a cross out and fix, is that a deletion and a corr? --> farm <!-- I think this looks more like bpom but that doesn't make much sense --> or temporary shed. It <gap reason="indecipherable" quantity="3" unit="chars"></gap> a permanent temple of the Muses. We should conclude, <!-- &amp; ?? --> rightly, that the Calcutta people are but <!-- not? --> admitted to public Evening amusement, but <!-- and? --> are fonder of resting at home after <pb/>the business if the day than of venturing abroad to the venus of hisoronic efforts.</p>
            <p>Taking this circumstance into consideration, we write <!-- were? -->glad to see <del>to</del> so fair an audience apemled <!-- Are we sure that is a dubble s? It looks like a p --> together on <del><gap reason = "indecipherable"></gap></del>Thursday Evening, to witness the first performance of the "Sailors from the Chesapeke". The Theatre, on entering is far from unpleasing in appearance; the decorations of pained cancas, assisted by the lighted lamps, gave to it an air of decided taste and beauty, <del>at</del>which on the present occation was heightened by the female faces, dark &amp; fair, who occupied the front circle of raised seats. The little semicircular box was chiefly filled by Naval <del><gap reason = "indecipherable"></gap></del>Officers from the Chesapeake, and a select number of our own Bluejackets.</p>
