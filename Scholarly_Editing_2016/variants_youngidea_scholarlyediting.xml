                <!-- I am altering the process Wesley and Les used in UTC because the variation 
                    I'm tracking is the location of particular contributions. So, the contribution remains mostly the same but the particular location of it changes. 
                I think this means that I should use <app loc...> to indicate a particular contribution in TYI and then explain where it appears in BETYI with the 
                <rdg wit...> element. I then use <ref target=""> to point to the same URI that I give in the <app loc=""> tag within the item in this list. 
                This is imperfect because I'm using a base text, so when there's something that doesn't appear in McArthur that does
                appear in Bampfield, I don't have an obvious piece of text to connect the note to. I will include it here but call it "BETYI7.01" 
                and then in the witness I include what position it occurs in BETYI. I can link it to the text with a big red ASTERISK perhaps?-->

                                of going round her Decks, and observing the arrangements made for
                                the conveyance of the sick and wounded. On the upper troop-Deck, the
                                swinging Cots were strung true and free on either side, &amp;
                                contained many poor fellows who had lost an arm or a leg in the late
                                war: they had mostly formed a portion of the gallant little army
                                which followed General Havelock to Cawnpore and Lucknow. It was
                                distressing to see so many fine young soldiers maimed &amp;
                                mutilated for life by the shot or shell of these detestable Sepoys;
                                but a happy cheerful spirit seemed to pervade them all, &amp; one
                                poor fellow who had lost both eyes by one musket shot, seemed the
                                happiest &amp; merriest of them all, as he was led about between 2
                                of his comrades. The lower troop-Deck was fitted with <gap
                                    reason="indecipherable"/> for the convalescent: a few soldiers
                                wives and children were also there, &amp; we were struck by the
                                sight of one poor fellow, who had lost one of his arms, nursing his
                                little baby with the other. A few ladies also, who have endured the
                                siege of Lucknow, but have left it widowed, are going home in the
                                "Himalaya" as Cabin passengers.</rdg>

                                Instead, the following review (attributed to McArthur) appears as
                                the second contribution to issue 12:<lb/> The Theatre <lb/>The
                                "Calcutta Lyric Theatre," as it is grandly called is but a poor
                                building, constructed entirely of bamboos &amp; palm-leaf staffing.
                                Standing as it does, in the Esplanade, under the shadow of the
                                Ochterbury Monument, &amp; in sight of the Government House, &amp;
                                other magnificent buildings, it looks a deal more like some country
                                    <del>farm</del> barn or temporary shed, <gap
                                    reason="indecipherable"/> a permanent temple of the Muses. We
                                should conclude, &amp; rightly, that the Calcutta people are not
                                admitted to public Evening amusements, &amp; are fonder of resting
                                at home after the business of the day than of venturing abroad to
                                the venue of histrionic efforts.<lb/>Taking this circumstance into
                                consideration, we were glad to see so fair an audience assembled
                                together on Thursday evening to witness the first performance of the
                                "Sailors from the Chesapeake." The Theatre, on entering is far from
                                unpleasing in appearance; the decorations of painted canvas,
                                assisted by the lighted lamps, gave to it an air of decided taste
                                and beauty, which on the present occasion was heightened by the
                                female faces, dark &amp; fair, who occupied the front circle of
                                raised seats. The little semicircular box was chiefly filled by
                                Naval Officers from the Chesapeake, and a select number of our own
                                Bluejackets. The Orchestra contained the Chesapeake band, which if
                                somewhat too noisy from the predominance of brass instruments, at
                                least contributed much to the pleasure of the Evening. The "Royal"
                                Box, in the center of the raised seats, was on this occasion
                                occupied by Commodore Watson, &amp; other patrons of the
                                entertainment, on whose entrance the audience rose, the Band playing
                                our National Anthem. <lb/>But we must now speak of our Actors &amp;

                                develop the various talents of the actors. Geo Horner, as the old
                                Miser, sustained his tragic part most admirably, while St Underhill,
                                as Simon Siggel, in the hunger which he so well pourtrayed, not only
                                called down roars of laughter from the house, but produced a
                                sympathetic feeling, which we were under the necessity of allaying
                                directly the Theatre closed. J. Walshe, as the Dutch Robber, was
                                very clever, &amp; Isaac Wright as the English robber from S. Giles,
                                was no less droll. Great credit also must be given to <choice>

                                both with the dance &amp; song. <lb/>In "Bombastes Furioso," we will
                                content ourselves by saying that all sustained their parts
                                admirably, &amp; that roars of laughter resounded thro' the house.
                                As this was the first time that our Chesapeake Amateurs have
                                appeared before a public audience, we must say that the highest
                                credit is due. <lb/>We close our notice by publishing the excellent
                                Prologue, by Henry Montagu, which was written expressly for this
                                occasion, &amp; spoken by him before the Curtain rose.
